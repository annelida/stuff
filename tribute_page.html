	    <h2>Margaret Thatcher's biography:</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li><strong>1925</strong> - Born in Grantham, England</li>
	      <li><strong>1943</strong> - Margaret went to the University of Qxford to study Chemistry. She was elected president of the student's Conservative Association </li>
	      <li><strong>1950</strong> - In 1949, Margaret moved to the safe Labour seat of Dartford, to stand for election as an MP. She failed tp get elected in 1950 and 1951, but remained undaunted. In 1951 she decided study law. She married Denic Thatcher. </li>
	      <li><strong>1959</strong> - When the Conservatives, led by harold Macmilan, swept to power, Margaret Thatcher won the safe seat of Finchley. In 1961 Mrs Thatcher was appointed as a parliamentary under secretary for pensions and national insurance. She was the youngest woman ever to take on this role. </li>
	      <li><strong>1970</strong> - In 1970, when the Conservatives won the general election, PM Edward Heath appointed Margaret Thatcher to his cabinet as minister for education.
		Willie Whitelaw, Leader of the House of Commons, warned Heath: "Once she's there we'll never get rid of her”. Thatcher pushed through cuts in education spending and caused public furore when she ended the provision of free milk for primary school children. This earned her the nickname 'Thatcher the Milk Snatcher'. In 1974, during the miner’s strike, Heath's government was forced to impose a three-day working week to conserve electricity. She never forgot the chaos she blamed on the unions.</li>    <li><strong>1975</strong> - After the Tories lost the 1974 election, Margaret Thatcher stood against Edward Heath for leadership of the party, forcing him to resign.
		Mrs Thatcher was seen as a right-wing outsider – a surprise candidate with little support. However, she galvanised disillusioned backbenchers with her strong rhetoric and forceful style. In February she was successfully elected Conservative leader. Some thought her leadership wouldn't last. In opposition she broke with consensus politics and moved her party to the right. She was influenced by her colleague Keith Joseph's ideas of free-market Conservatism and of reducing the power of the unions</li>
	      <li><strong>1979</strong> - Thatcher’s Conservatives swept to victory against a beleaguered Labour party whose term had been wracked by the worst industrial unrest in 50 years.
		Mrs Thatcher portrayed herself as a practical housewife who could sort out the nation’s finances. Her message was simple: “Labour isn’t working.” With the economy in a shambles, the new prime minister knew she had a challenging job to do. She promised to curb the power of the unions and bring stability to the country, while championing free markets and arguing that individuals should be given the power to make their own success.</li>     <li><strong>1980</strong> - Despite Thatcher's promises to sort out the nation’s finances, the UK fell into recession. Critics called for a U-turn, but she was defiant.
		Margaret Thatcher’s economic policies did not bring inflation under control and increased unemployment which rose to two million. That summer riots broke out in British cities. Polls showed she was the most unpopular prime minister since records began. Thatcher sacked the more moderate Tory ‘wets’ and at the 1980 Conservative party conference vowed to hold firm to her policies. However, when the miners threatened a strike in early 1981, the government did back down.</li>
	      <li><strong>1982</strong> - n April, Argentina invaded the British-ruled Falkland Islands. The Foreign Office wanted a peaceful settlement, but Thatcher disagreed.
		Like her hero Churchill, Thatcher was adamant that Britain would not give in to foreign aggression. In a matter of days she sent a force to expel the Argentinian army. During the conflict 649 Argentine soldiers and 255 British troops lost their lives. After 10 weeks of fighting the islands were retaken and an Argentinian white flag flew over the capital Fort Stanley. As a result her popularity with the public soared and she gained respect and strength abroad. </li>
	      <li><strong>1983</strong> - In June 1983 Thatcher called a general election and increased her party's majority. Her radical economic policies changed the face of Britain.
		Her ideas of individualism and personal responsibility captured the public's imagination. Millions grabbed the chance to buy their council houses and buy shares in rapidly privatised utilities such as British Rail, British Telecommunications and British Gas. Thatcher also presided over the de-regulation of financial institutions in the City. The economy boomed and London became a massive financial centre. However this success had a downside. Inequality and homelessness increased across Britain.</li>
	      <li><strong>1984</strong> - n response to planned pit closures, miners union leader Arthur Scargill ordered a strike, threatening Britain's power supply. Thatcher stood firm.
		The biggest clash was a pitched battle at Orgreave near Sheffield, where 7,000 police fought 5,000 strikers. Mrs Thatcher refused to bow under pressure. She stockpiled coal at power stations and deployed the police to break picket lines. After 12 months the miners were defeated and returned to work. The trade union movement was greatly weakened. Thatcher’s actions were supported by her party and the British Establishment. However she became a hate figure among many working class communities. In 1984, at the Conservative Party Conference in Brighton, Margaret Thatcher narrowly survived the IRA bombing of her hotel.</li>
	      <li><strong>1988</strong> - For much of her career, Margaret Thatcher was a pro-European. Yet later in her premiership her ideas began to change.
		Although Europe was important for trade, Thatcher was opposed to the idea of Britain ceding power to European institutions. In July 1988, European Commission President, Jacques Delors, spoke about the beginnings of a European government. In Bruges that year Thatcher issued a firm riposte to the idea of a European super-state and reaffirmed Britain's sovereignty. The speech was applauded by some, but opened up divisions within the Conservative Party over European policy.</li>
	      <li><strong>1990</strong> - After winning a third General election in 1987, Thatcher introduced the Poll Tax. This proved a huge political mistake.
		Local council rates were replaced with a flat Community Charge that everyone paid regardless of income. Margaret Thatcher drove the policy through without consulting her colleagues. Riots and marches erupted across the UK. In March around 100,000 protestors descended on London under the slogan “Can't pay, won't pay”; 340 people were arrested and 113 injured. The policy was unpopular with the public and caused many Tory MPs to lose faith in their prime minister. Again, she refused to give in.The Poll Tax, disputes over Europe and an overbearing attitude lost Margaret Thatcher support within her own party.
		Former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine stood against her in a leadership election. Thatcher felt betrayed. Facing a leadership vote she called in members of her cabinet one by one to try to win their support. She wrote later “Almost to a man they used the same formula. This was that they themselves would back me, of course, but that regretfully they did not believe I could win.” Margaret Thatcher resigned and left Downing Street as Prime Minister for the last time on 28 November 1990.</li>
	      <li><strong>2007</strong> - After resigning as prime minister, Margaret Thatcher wrote her memoirs and continued to make speeches around the world.
		In 1992 she was given a life peerage and became Baroness Thatcher. She continued to be politically active and became a figurehead for anti-European sentiment in the Conservative party. In June 2003, Margaret Thatcher's husband Denis died and her public appearances became more infrequent. In 2007 she became the first living prime minister to be honoured with a statue in the Houses of Parliament. It stands opposite a statue of her hero Winston Churchill.</li>
	      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Margaret Thatcher died following a stroke, aged 87. She was the first British PM since Winston Churchill to be granted a state funeral.
		Thatcher’s death proved as controversial as her time in power. It was celebrated by some. After an internet campaign, Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead got to number two in the charts. Her funeral at St Paul's Cathedral was attended by the Queen. Few politicians provoke such strong opinions – both pro and anti – as Thatcher. Her ideas about free markets and individualism influenced subsequent Conservative and Labour governments. She is arguably Britain’s most influential post-war prime minister.</li>
