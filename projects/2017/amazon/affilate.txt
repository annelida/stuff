Hello

I've just reviewed Amazon affilate program and took an attempt to
participate there. Unfortunately it is impossible to me to verify
identity there. Perhaps it is so because my phone is Ukrainian and I
trying to affilate with US Amazon web store. Could you review a
screenshot below, please?

Could you try to register on Amazon affilate program by yourself,
please? It is absolutely costless and in certain circumstances should
be as a nudge into right direction to you also. This is a link to follow:

https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/

All I need for further development are its credentials:

config = {
    'access_key': 'ABCDEFG1234X',
    'secret_key': 'Ydjkei78HdkffdklieAHDJWE3134',
    'associate_tag': 'redtoad-10',
    'locale': 'us'
}

If access_key and secret_key you'll get after successful registration, an
associate_tag you'll define by yourself during this procedure.

In any case an exhaustive tuturial is there:
