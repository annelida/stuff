Hi, Vladimir

Tomorrow, I'll investigate the API data structure and compare the data
that is extracted by the code you provide and data that extracted
using Amazon Scraper framework.

Also, I'll measure:
- the time required for processing one request
- the speed of processing 100 requests.

In the future this will allow me to understand which of the
existing methods in this project can be applied to obtain the optimal
results.

Best regards,
Vikky.
