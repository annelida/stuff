Hi, Vladimir

Tomorrow, I'll investigate the API data structure and compare the it
with properties that is extracted by the code you provide and data
that extracted by Amazon Scraper framework
https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/amazon_scraper

Also, I'll take an attempt to measure:
- the time required for processing one request;
- time which spent on parsing all related reviews there;
- the speed of processing 100 requests/responses;
- bunch execution time.

Now it seems to me that Amazon API limitation in 3600
requests/responses per hour is the only bottleneck there. Any Python
host would be in charge to parse available reviews less than in one
second. Thus, a multithreading/multiprocessing are redundant in this
particular case.

Further this should allow me to understand which of the existing
 methods can be applied to obtain the optimal results and finish 'Raw
 Techspecs' composing. Of cause I'll share its template with you for
 corrections and approval.

Bee in touch, please.

Best regards,
Vikky.
