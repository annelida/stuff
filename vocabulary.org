**** Expressing Disapproval
Lucinda: Maggie and Gerry are moving in together. They want to start a family. 

Thomas: I don’t approve of that. They’re not married and it’s a disgrace. Shame on them! 

Lucinda: I understand your objections, but they love each other and need our support, not our condemnation. 

Thomas: If I were their parents, I’d give them an earful. Someone should take them to task for making such irresponsible decisions. 

Lucinda: They know what they’re doing and it’s not our place to criticize their decision. 

Thomas: But I don’t have to like it. I’m not sending them a housewarming gift, that’s for sure. 

Lucinda: Too late. I sent one and signed both our names.

Brianna: Why? 

Viktor: I feel a sense of foreboding. I have a sneaking suspicion that things aren’t going to go well. 

Brianna: Under the circumstances, I can understand your reluctance, but it’s like ripping off a bandage. It’s best done quickly. 

Viktor: I’m not sure about that. I have a feeling that things are going to go very, very wrong, and the longer I can put it off the better. 

Brianna: Next week is your girlfriend’s birthday. You don’t want to break up with her on her birthday, do you? 

Viktor: No, that would be cruel. Maybe I should hold off until after next week. 

Brianna: You’re really dreading breaking up with her, aren’t you? 

Viktor: She’s got a temper. When I told her that I couldn’t join her on a visit to her parents’ house last weekend, she went ballistic, and I have dents in my car door to show for it. I expect this to be much, much worse.

**** Describing Student Achievement

Jeannie: Everything okay? 

William: No, I just got off the phone with my daughter’s school and they’re not putting her in the gifted and talented program. 

Jeannie: That’s disappointing, but wasn’t she struggling in school last year? 

William: Her teachers were thinking of putting her in remedial classes. Can you believe that? My daughter is getting poor grades because she’s bored in school. She tunes out. She’d be coasting in her classes if the teachers would just challenge her. 

Jeannie: Are you sure that’s the problem? My son was considered low- achieving in the lower grades, but since starting high school, he’s doing a lot better. 

William: I’m telling you, my daughter could be high- achieving if they’d only put her in the gifted and talented program. It’s all about teacher expectations. 

Jeannie: Well, it’s not all about expectations… 

William: Are you trying to tell me that my daughter is slow and I should just accept it? 

Jeannie: I’m saying that kids develop at their own pace. Some are late bloomers. 

William: Nobody in my family has ever been late in anything, and they’re not going to start now. 

Jeannie: Putting pressure on her might make matters worse. 

William: Who’s putting pressure on her? Maybe I can help her by getting her tutors in every subject and enrolling her in summer programs.

William: And let her waste her potential? What kind of father would I be then?

**** Questioning Mental Competency

Claire: What are you doing with all those law books? I thought you retired 20 years ago. 

Ray: I’m preparing for my mental competency hearing. 

Claire: Mental competency hearing? But your mind is as sharp as it has ever been. 

Ray: That’s not what my children think. They are going to court to prove my diminished capacity. They are going to argue that I need a conservator for my estate. 

Claire: Nobody who knows you would question your sound mind. There must be another reason for this hearing. 

Ray: You’re right. My children want to get their hands on my money, and if they can prove mental incapacitation and impaired judgment, they will get power of attorney. 

Claire: And if they get power of attorney… 

Ray: They would get control of my company and my entire estate. 

Claire: So what are you going to do? 

Ray: I am going to fight fire with fire. I’m suing them.

Rosa: They’re just trying to get a rise out of you. Maybe if you ignore them and stop waving them off and telling them to run along, they’ll go away on their own. 

Joshua: If I don’t tell them to get lost, they’ll sit here in front of my house and clown around. They’ll make so much noise it’ll wreck my peace and quiet. Hey, I see you. Take a hike! 

Rosa: I think I know what to do to get you that peace and quiet. I’ll be right back.

Becca: Hmm, maybe you shouldn’t be telling me about your conquests. 

Jonah: Why not? It’s no secret that I’ve got game. Chicks dig me. Last week alone I… 

Becca: Really, I think I’ll take a pass on the play-by-play.

Becca: No, thanks. I’m leaving. 

Jonah: Wait! Are you going to put in a good word for me with Jessica? 

Becca: You know that she’s a good friend of mine, right? 

Jonah: Of course, I do. That’s why I’m asking you. 

Becca: And you thought I’d set her up with a player?

Bill: Yes, you’re right. 

Madison: And I hope you remembered to bring something to drink. I’m thirsty. 

Bill: I brought both food and a bottle of champagne. 

Madison: Well, I hope the food isn’t too cold and the champagne isn’t too warm. You know how I hate warm champagne. 

Bill: Actually the food is cold because I brought chicken sandwiches and potato salad. 

Madison: Oh, I thought you would have brought something a little more, well, gourmet or lavish, something a little special. 

Bill: That’s why I brought the champagne. It’ll make this picnic extra special. 

Madison: I guess we’ll have to make do with warm champagne and sandwiches. I hope you remembered to bring a corkscrew and some dishes and silverware. 

Bill: I bought paper plates and plastic utensils.

**** Tracing One's Genealogy
Aaron: Do you think you can help me trace my genealogy? 

Corrie: Sure, I can try. We can get started by talking to your parents and grandparents. Oral interviews will give us some names of your relatives. 

Aaron: I’ve already talked to them and I grew up hearing stories about my lineage on both sides of my family. 

Corrie: That’s great. If you know some of the people you’re descended from, we can start by looking at public records and historical records from the area. You’re from Tennessee, right? 

Aaron: That’s right. There are a lot of people in Tennessee with my last name, though. 

Corrie: Well, we can triangulate the information we get to zero in on your ancestors. 

Aaron: What if I want proof positive that I’m related to someone? 

Corrie: Then you can have a genetic analysis done. A DNA test is generally accepted proof. 

Aaron: Good, it’s about time someone in my family established the blood connections. 

Corrie: Blood connections to whom? 

Aaron: Elvis, of course. 

Corrie: Elvis?! You think you’re related to Elvis? 

Aaron: His last name was Presley; my last name is Presley. My first name is Aaron; his middle name was Aaron. It can’t be a coincidence, especially considering my talent. 

Corrie: Talent?

Priscilla: Same old, same old. It isn’t a family gathering without a major meltdown or blowup. 

Oscar: Yikes, what happened? 

Priscilla: You know how it is. It starts out with bickering and somebody taking offense at some slight or dig, or bringing up some old grievance. 

Oscar: Well, that happens in most families. 

Priscilla: Yeah, but in mine, they often turn into screaming matches. We all raise our voices and somebody always storms out. 

Oscar: Even at your mother’s birthday dinner? 

Priscilla: The occasion doesn’t matter. My mother tries to be the peacemaker, but it doesn’t take much for tempers to flare.

Oscar: That never happens in my family. 

Priscilla: What?! Your family doesn’t fight when it gets together? 

Oscar: No, we try to sweep things under the rug and put on a brave face. 

Priscilla: What happens when you get mad at each other?

George: Moving on! Have you seen any good movies lately? 

Lila: Listen, all of your friends are settling down and you don’t want to go through life alone and lonely… 

George: That reminds me, didn’t you say that you were going to get another dog so that Rover isn’t lonely when you’re not home? 

Lila: Forget about my dog. You remember Rachel, don’t you? She just broke up with her boyfriend and she’d be perfect for you. 

George: Speaking of Rachel, how is her mother? Wasn’t she in the hospital? 

Lila: If Rachel isn’t your type, how about Amina? She has great legs and I know you’re a leg man. 

George: And now for something completely different…How is your diet coming along? Have you lost any weight yet? 

Lila: I don’t really want to talk about my weight.

Dad: Okay, everybody, take your places. 

Mom: We’re in our places. Can’t the photographer just take the photo? 

Dad: We have to pose. The whole point is to look natural. 

Mom: If you wanted a natural family photo, why are we in a portrait studio in the middle of a sitting? 

Dad: I want us to stand in front of a nice background and pose with nice props. I’m tired of looking at the photos that we take. They’re not very good and require hours of touching up or creative cropping. 

Mom: Instead, we’re supposed to look natural wearing color- coordinated clothing and standing in unlikely poses. 

Dad: Don’t be like that. Generations to come will cherish this family photo. 

Mom: I doubt it. 

Dad: How about if I ask the photographer to take some shots just of you? 

Mom: You mean like the headshots Hollywood stars get? 

Dad: Uh, sure, if that’s what you’d want.

Nico: There are too many reminders here. I want a clean slate. What’s done is done and I’m tired of blame and recriminations. 

Celia: I’m glad to hear you’ve stopped beating yourself up over what’s happened, but are you sure moving away will help you move on? 

Nico: The world is my oyster now, isn’t it? I can live anywhere I want to and do anything I want to. 

Celia: I guess so, but are you sure you want to uproot and leave town? 

Nico: I’m not trying to reinvent myself, but if I’m going to start over, I might as well do it in a new town. 

Celia: I guess a new town is a good place to start a new life and maybe you’ll find a new love. Many people bounce back from a difficult divorce.

Celeste: No, I want to be prepared. Here, take a look. See what you think. 

Albert: Ezekiel?! You want to name our child Ezekiel? He’ll be teased by every kid in school. 

Celeste: It’s a family name. I was trying to appease my parents. They’ve been suggesting a lot of family names. We could call him by a nickname, maybe “Zeke.” 

Albert: I’m not naming my child Ezekiel. His name would be Ezekiel Eckleman. That’s a mouthful. I also want to steer clear of alliterative names. I’ve never liked them. 

Celeste: Okay, are there any names you like on my list? 

Albert: Not Alan Phillip. That’s for sure. 

Celeste: Why not? I thought we’d name the baby after my grandfather. Alan is a nice first name and Phillip is a nice middle name. 

Albert: His initials would be “A.P.E.” – ape! He would never live that down. 

Celeste: How about “Mikol”? 

Albert: You mean an alternate spelling for “Michael”? People don’t know how to pronounce a name with an odd spelling. 

Celeste: Well, are there any names you do like?

Venus: This is obscene! Look at the bare breasts on that one and the one over there is topless. That man’s private parts are on display for everyone to see. Most of these are butt naked! 

Milo: Can’t you see past the nudity to appreciate the artists’ creations? 

Venus: I’m not one of those people who go to nude beaches and run around in their birthday suit completely uninhibited. This is shameful! 

Milo: This isn’t a nude beach. It’s a museum. Your kids are here to appreciate some of the finest art in history. 

Venus: I don’t call this art. I call it pornography. I’m taking my kids out of here. Oh my God, there are full frontals wherever you look! Kids, keep your eyes covered. We’re leaving.

Carla: It was your mother – again. She wanted to give me another piece of unsolicited advice about housekeeping. She’s called five times this week already. 

Marc: She’s just trying to be helpful. 

Carla: I wish she’d do it without being so critical. I feel like she enjoys finding fault with everything I do. 

Marc: She’s a little overeager to help, that’s all. Don’t think of it as her interfering. Think of it as her giving you support. She isn’t like your mother. 

Carla: What do you mean? 

Marc: What do I mean?! She’s constantly giving me advice on how to be a better husband. 

Carla: Well, we just got married and she wants our marriage to be the best it can be. 

Marc: I know, but your mother has a really sharp tongue and she doesn’t hold back. She butts in whenever I’m trying to do something to tell me how to do it better. 

Carla: Just like your mother, she’s only trying to help. 

Marc: With her constant sarcastic comments? 

Carla: That’s just her sense of humor. She doesn’t mean anything by it. She likes you. 

Marc: She has a strange way of showing it. 

Carla: All of this talk about mothers-in-law is getting our blood up. At this rate, we won’t be able to follow the best piece of marriage advice we’ve received so far. 

Marc: Which was? 

Carla: Don’t go to bed angry.

**** Dating Nice Guys and Bad Boys 
Jack: I’ve had it. I’m going to start treating women like dirt. I’d get more dates. 

Alison: What brought this on? 

Jack: I got dumped again by a woman who thinks I’m too nice – too nice! She says she wants to be with someone who’s more assertive and unpredictable. She didn’t say it in so many words, but that means she thinks I’m a wimp and I’m boring. 

Alison: My guess is she wants a bad boy. A lot of women go through that phase. We want excitement and drama, the thrill of the chase. 

Jack: You mean they choose to be with selfish, irresponsible jerks because it’s exciting? 

Alison: I hate to say it, but it’s true. But I’m telling you, this phase doesn’t last in most women. When we want to settle down, that’s when we look for the nice guys. 

Jack: You mean I have to wait until then to get a nice girlfriend? 

Alison: No, I simply mean that until then, nice guys finish last. 

Jack: Well, I’m not willing to wait. 

Alison: Where are you going? 

Jack: I’m going to work on my swagger and my sneer.

* competition :Study:
[2017-03-29 Wed 07:12]

Соревнование
If you are trying to win or attempting to prove you're the best,
you're in a competition. The word also describes your opponent in
sports, business, and politics.

If you're trying to beat out someone else — whether in the Olympics or
a pie-baking contest — it's a competition, and the other contestants
are called the competition too. If you describe something as a
"friendly competition," you're saying the outcome isn't critical, or
there's no money involved. If you do something impressive in order to
win, people will say competition brings out the best in you. If you
try to injure your opponent, they'll say it brings out the worst.

* raise :Study:
[2017-03-29 Wed 17:04]
Поднимать

If you raise your hand, you put it up in the air. If you raise your
daughter, you “bring her up” from childhood to adulthood. And, if you
raise the roof, you and a crowd of people cheer wildly for a
performer.

Raise can be used almost any time you bring something up, either
literally: “if you raise the lid on that trap door you will see a
secret passage,” or figuratively: “please don't raise the topic of my
arachnophobia.” The verb raise comes from the Old English word ræran,
which means “to rear,” as in, “do you really want to raise your
children in that town?” As a noun, a raise can also mean a salary
increase.

‘C-x 5 o’
     Select another frame, and raise it.
* led :Study:
[2017-03-30 Thu 06:45]

Свет, индикатор

To lead means to go in front, or to serve as the leader of a group. If
you’re on a group hiking trip and the navigator lost the map, you’ll
want someone with a good sense of direction to lead the group back to
the car.

If you have done excellent, groundbreaking research into cancer
treatment, someone might say you lead the field in finding a cure for
cancer. If we say a football team has a strong lead, that means that
they’re on the way to winning a game. If you are a detective and you
discover a room full of evidence on a case, that might lead to its
solution.

* enough :Study:
[2017-03-30 Thu 07:21]

Достаточно

When there's enough of something, you don't need or want anymore. When
there's not enough, there's too little.

If someone fills your glass almost to the top, that's enough. If you
ate one slice of pizza but are still hungry, you haven't had enough.
Although enough has to do with the amount of something, it isn't
precise like a number. When someone is annoyed — like with a barking
dog — they might say "That's enough!" When you've had enough, you've
had as much as you want.

This method is already enough to use regular expressions in

* distinct :Study:
[2017-03-31 Fri 07:33]

Отчетливый

When something is distinct, it is easily identifiable or set apart
from others of its kind. An eighth-grader who is six feet tall has a
distinct advantage over the other kids on the basketball court.

A thing can be distinct if it is easy to see, either because it is
different in some way from the things around it or if it is more clear
and visible, as in: “The license number of the getaway car was more
distinct once I cleaned my glasses.” The word distinct comes from “to
distinguish,” which is when a person or thing is set apart from the
pack: “The research that she did was distinct in its attention to
detail.”

* pavement :Study:
[2017-03-31 Fri 08:14]

Тротуар

Pavement is a hard surface that's covered in concrete or asphalt, like
a road or a driveway. If you wipe out on your bike and land on the
pavement, you may end up with skinned knees or scraped elbows.

When pavement is newly surfaced or patched, it's smooth and even — but
after a long, cold winter pavement is often full of potholes and
cracks. In the US, pavement most often refers to a road or street, but
it can also mean any paved surface, like a sidewalk or paved area in a
park. The word has a Latin root, pavimentum, "level surface that's
been beaten firm."

- There's some broken glass on the pavement.
* quiet :Study:
[2017-04-02 Sun 10:50]

Тихо

To be quiet means you don't make any noise. When you’re trying not to
wake a sleeping lion, you will be quiet when you run by it.

The versatile quiet, which can be a noun, adjective, or verb (to quiet
others), is one of those words that is best understood through its
antonyms — loud or hectic. Let a marching band practice in your
apartment, and you will long for a little quiet. Quiet is one of those
words that thankfully follow the "i" before "e," except after "c"
spelling rule.

Be quiet!

* core :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:34]

Ядро

If you're looking for the most essential part or the very center of
something, you're looking for its core. Like the inedible middle of an
apple or your inner circle of core friends.

In the late 14th century, the noun core came about from the Old French
coeur, meaning “core of fruit” and more literally, “heart.” So the
core of something is its very heart, whether you're talking about the
seed-containing center of a fruit, the central meaning of a book, or
the core courses you need to take in order to graduate.
* prominent :Study:

Выдающийся

[2017-04-03 Mon 14:34]

If you're looking for an adjective that means "sticking out above the
rest; famous," consider prominent. A prominent person might be the big
cheese, the head honcho, the top dog — not just any Joe Schmo.

A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain
ridge. Prominent, then, means "sticking out" either in a literal sense
("a prominent nose") or a figurative one ("a prominent figure in the
industry"). The metaphorical sense of "famous" is the most common one
today, though references to the "prominent posterior" of Jennifer
Lopez might fit both definitions.

* devote :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:35]

Посвятить

Devote means to give to. If you devote yourself to jump-roping, you
might be found in your driveway every free moment of the day
practicing.

Nuns and priests are said to devote their lives to God. A knight in
shining armor devotes himself to his lady. If you devote as much
energy to your school work as you do to your hair, your grades should
improve. If our country devoted to education even half of the
resources we pour into defense, we could eliminate poverty.

* shrink :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:35]

Сокращаться

Shrink is the informal word you can use to talk about a therapist.
Talking about your problems with her can hopefully help you shrink
them, or make them smaller.

The word shrink is related to the Swedish skrynka meaning "to
wrinkle." Think about what happens to a lone forgotten fruit at the
bottom of your fridge drawer. After a while, it begins to wrinkle or
shrink. Clothes washed in hot water tend to shrink, so be wary of the
setting on your washing machine. The use of shrink as referring to
therapists started as late as the 1960s — with the idea of a
psychologist being a "head-shrinker."

* agile :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:35]

Подвижный

On water skis she was agile and made sharp turns and long arcs cutting
through the water, but she was a lot less agile on the snowboard,
landing on her face and hands as she clunked down the slopes.

People and things can be agile, or quick and graceful. Car commercials
talk of "agile handling," and nature-shows feature spry creatures who
survive by being agile among more slow-footed and clumsy animals.
Human and virtual minds also earn the description agile when they're
sharp and grasp ideas or reason with speed and easy logic. Things that
are agile often are thought to be light, but even heavy machines like
trains and large people like sumo wrestlers can be agile.

* asset :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:36]

Актив

An asset is something you have that is positive. It can mean a piece
of property, a piece of equipment, an ability, or even a quality.

"Her facility with math is an asset when it comes to figuring out the
restaurant tab. She is an asset to the group." A person's overall
financial picture is determined by lining up everything they own in
the asset column, and everything they own in the liability (or debit)
column.

* pique :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:36]

Пике

The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when
something piques your interest or curiosity, here the verb pique just
means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

Both the noun and verb are pronounced "pēk" and were borrowed from a
French word meaning "a prick, irritation," from Old French, from
piquer "to prick." So you can see how something that pricks you could
make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make
you want to storm away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the
by, might be called a "fit of pique."

* dig :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:36]

Копать

When you dig, you scoop or shovel up dirt, sand, or some other
material. Your dog might whine to go outside so she can dig a hole in
your dad's garden.

You can dig with your hands, a shovel, or even a tractor or backhoe.
City crews dig up roads to repair water pipes, and gardeners dig small
for planting bulbs. You can even say you dig your brother in the side
when you jab him there. If someone says, "I dig you," they mean, "I
understand," and if they say, "I dig your outfit," they like it. Both
slang usages come from 1930s African American English.
* sleeves :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:37]

Рукава

The part of your clothing that covers your arm (or part of your arm)
is a sleeve. Some t-shirts have long sleeves, others have short
sleeves, and your tank top doesn't have any sleeves at all.

On a hot day, you might roll up the sleeves of your shirt, or you
might change into one with short sleeves (or no sleeves at all, also
known as sleeveless). Another kind of sleeve is a container or
protective covering, like a record sleeve or a sleeve of crackers. If
you have something "up your sleeve," it means you're hiding something
to use later in a surprising way.
* peek :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:37]

Заглянуть

When you peek, you take a quick glance at something. It's incredibly
tempting when you're little to peek at your birthday presents, but you
soon learn how disappointing it is to spoil the surprise.

A sneaky look at something is a peek. You might peek at someone if
you're shy or you don't want them to catch you looking. You can also
describe a glance at a part of something as "a peek" — like when you
take a peek at a napping child. Peek comes from piken, a 14th century
word meaning "look quickly and slyly." Until the 15th century, the
word peek was used interchangeably with keek and peep.

* persistence :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:37]

Упорство

Persistence is the ability to stick with something. If you practice
the violin for over a year in order to play "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star" perfectly, that's persistence!

Persistence can also mean something that lasts for a very long time.
The persistence of bullying, despite years of efforts by the school,
has frustrated many parents. Bed bugs are known for their persistence.
Despite near eradication in the 1950s, they are back and harder to
eliminate than ever.

* overlap :Study:
[2017-04-03 Mon 14:38]

Перекрывать

When things overlap, part or all of one thing covers part or all of
the other, like roofing shingles or flat noodles in a lasagna dish.

Not only can things overlap, but schedules can, too. If you
accidentally schedule your doctor's appointment and your dentist
appointment at the same time, they overlap, which is unfortunate
because you can't be in two places at once. Philosophies and
perspectives overlap when they share certain points or ideas in
common.


* demand :Study:
[2017-04-04 Tue 06:46]

Спрос

Demand means "an urgent request," like your demand that teachers give
no homework on the weekend, or the act of making the request —
teachers who demand that the work get done, even if it's the weekend.

Demand comes from the Old French word demander, meaning "ask, make
inquiry." A demand is a lot stronger than that, however. When you
demand something, you want action now. A demand can also mean "to
require" like cold weather that demands warm coats and boots. Demand
is also an economic term, meaning "the amount of an item that can be
sold," like the demand for those snow boots: high in winter and
nonexistent in summer.

The lambda feature was added to Python due to
the demand from Lisp programmers.

 2. злоба (malice, spite, rancor, venom, malevolence, despite)
 3. озлобленность (spite, exasperation, rancor, rancour)
 4. неприязнь (dislike, distaste, enmity, disaffection, objection, spite)
 5. недоброжелательство (grudge, spite, jaundice)
 6. враждебность (hostility, animosity, enmity, animus, ill will, spite)
 7. недовольство (discontent, dissatisfaction, displeasure, complaint, grudge, spite)
 8. зависть (envy, jealousy, grudge, jaundice, spite, heartburning)

verb
 1. делать назло (spite)
 2. насаливать (salt, spite)
 3. досаждать (annoy, plague, molest, vex, torment, spite)


When your sister told you that you looked terrible in your new tube
top, she may have been saying it out of spite, or in a deliberately
mean or offensive way.

The noun spite means "a desire to offend." The word spite can also
take the form of a verb, when it's used like this: "He only became a
vegetarian to spite his cattle rancher father." Either way, spite
implies a grudge, a desire to offend or hurt the feelings of someone
by actions or words.

In spite of, despite and although are all used to show a contrast but there
are differences in the structures used with them.
* despite :Study:
[2017-04-06 Thu 09:35]

несмотря

adverb
 1. несмотря (despite)
 2. вопреки (contrary, despite, against, in opposition)

preposition
 1. несмотря на (despite, in spite of, notwithstanding, with, in despite of)

noun
 1. злоба (malice, spite, rancor, venom, malevolence, despite)
 2. презрение (contempt, scorn, disdain, despite)

Despite is used as a preposition when something happens even though it
might have been prevented by something else. You might go see a movie
despite hearing a review calling it worse than "Showgirls" and
"Ishtar" combined.

Despite is just one letter away from despise, and they actually share
a root: the Latin verb despicere, meaning "to look down on
scornfully." Despite came to mean "contempt" or "scorn" in English,
though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase
"in despite of" gradually got shortened to the preposition despite and
lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something despite the
obstacles in your way, there's no need to feel spiteful about it.


* crowd :Study:

толпа

noun
 1. толпа (crowd, throng, mob, huddle, swarm, multitude)
 2. народ (people, nation, folk, public, crowd, race)
 3. множество (multiplicity, plurality, variety, multitude, plenty, crowd)
 4. масса (mass, array, weight, lot, bulk, crowd)
 5. давка (crush, crowding, crowd, jam, cram, throng)

 7. толкотня (crush, hustle, crowd, crowding, cram, jostle)
 8. гурьба (crowd)
 9. простой люд (crowd)
10. статисты (crowd)
11. компания (company, bunch, party, partnership, gang, crowd)

verb
 1. толпиться (crowd, throng, mob, mill, swarm, mill about)
 2. вытеснять (displace, crowd out, supplant, supersede, crowd, oust)
 3. напирать (press, emphasize, crowd)
 4. тесниться (crowd, press, jostle, hustle, cluster, press round)
 5. теснить (narrow, crowd, press, jostle, hustle, press round)
 6. сгрудиться (crowd)
 7. торопить (rush, hurry, hasten, hurry up, haste, crowd)
 8. собираться толпой (crowd, troop, troop together, troop up)
 9. набиваться битком (jam, crowd)
10. скапливать (accumulate, crowd)
11. нагромождать (pile up, heap, heap up, stack, crowd, bulk)
12. оказывать давление (pressurize, exert, enforce, lean on, crowd, screw)
13. приставать (molest, adhere, accost, worry, tease, crowd)


A lot of people or things in a large group make up a crowd. The masses
of performers with painted faces, big shoes, and squeaky noses filling
up the streets during your town's annual clown parade can be described
as a crowd of clowns.

A crowd of people might gather for a party, concert, or demonstration,
with the word crowd implying that there's something a little
disorderly — noisy or unruly — about the group. Crowd can also mean
"the mass of ordinary people," which is the way you're using the word
when you say you want to "stand out from the crowd." You want to be
seen as a distinct, individual person, rather than part of a larger
mass of regular folks.


* auxiliary :Study:

Вспомогательный

adjective

 2. дополнительный (additional, more, further, complementary, extra, auxiliary)
 3. добавочный (additional, extra, surplus, supplementary, plus, auxiliary)
 4. запасной (spare, reserve, emergency, standby, auxiliary, store)

noun

 2. вспомогательный глагол (auxiliary)
 3. вспомогательное устройство (auxiliary, slave)
 4. вспомогательный механизм (assist, auxiliary, pilot, doctor)
 5. иностранные наемные войска (auxiliary)
 6. иностранные союзные войска (auxiliary)

When you're offering something in support of an already existing
thing, you're offering something auxiliary. The auxiliary police will
help out the regular police with things like directing traffic and
crowd control when there's a special event in town.

The Latin word auxilium means "help," and so auxiliary means something
that "helps" by providing backup or support. Think of auxiliary verbs
(sometimes called helper verbs), that provide support within a verb
phrase, as "is" does in "Helen is playing." You can have an auxiliary
engine in a car, an auxiliary cook at a restaurant, an auxiliary
electrical network at a factory, or auxiliary troops standing by
during battle. A "Ladies Auxiliary" functions as support for
institutions such as churches, synagogues, or charities.

In the present perfect, 'just' comes between the auxiliary verb ('have')

 3. сухой закон (prohibition)
 4. воспрещение (interdiction, prohibition, inhibition)
 5. блокирование (prohibition)
 6. запретительный судебный приказ (prohibition)


Prohibition is the act of forbidding or outlawing something, like when
my mom placed a prohibition on watching TV during dinner (causing
everyone to skip dinner).

Prohibition can also refer to one of the most famous acts of
prohibition in United States history: the outlawing of alcoholic
beverages from 1920 to 1933. During this period, known as the
"Prohibition Era" or just "Prohibition" for short, people continued to
obtain alcohol via illegal means. As a result, the Prohibition Era is
a perfect illustration of a major challenge associated with most acts
of prohibition: enforcement.

 6. улика (evidence, clue, piece of evidence)
 7. основание (base, basis, reason, bottom, foundation, evidence)
 8. свидетельское показание (evidence, attestation)

verb
 1. свидетельствовать (testify, witness, evidence, bear witness to, attest, point)
 2. служить доказательством (evidence, demonstrate, witness, manifest)
 3. доказывать (prove, argue, demonstrate, show, establish, evidence)


Evidence is anything that can be used to prove something — like the
evidence presented in a trial, or the trail of bread crumbs that is
evidence of the path Hansel took through the woods.

The word evidence is derived from the Latin ēvidēnt-, meaning
"obvious." The word evidence shows up frequently in legal documents
and dramas, because evidence is necessary proof in linking someone to
a crime or crime scene. Evidence is used in many ways to show that
something is true, as in "your enormous belly and blue 'Baby on board'
T-shirt are evidence that you're due to give birth any day."

We use *must* when we feel sure that something is true because there's
    very strong evidence.

Воры

adjective
 1. воровской (thieves', larcenous, burglarious)
 2. блатной (thieves', rogue)

A thief is someone who steals something. A thief can be anything from
a cyberspace criminal mastermind who steals credit card information
around the world, to the petty thief who picks people's pockets on the
subway.

Some famous thieves (notice the -v- in the plural) include outlaws of
the Old West, like Butch Cassidy and Jesse James, and those notorious
bank robbers of the 1930s with the memorable names — "Baby Face"
Nelson, "Pretty Boy" Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, Ma Barker, "Machine Gun"
Kelly, to name a few. They were so bold (and so brutal) that their

11. поощрять (encourage, promote, foster, stimulate, countenance, root)
12. поддерживать (support, maintain, endorse, sustain, encourage, root)
13. болеть за кого-л. (root, root for)

The root is the part of the plant that's underground. Dig up a potato,
and you will unearth its roots. Just pull them off before you cook the
potato.

Root comes from the Latin word radix, which means "starting point,"
and you can think of the root of something as the place it starts
from, whether that's the root of a tree, or the root of a problem. The
root of your fear of swimming might have been a scary shark attack
movie. If your ancestors come from Guatemala, you have Guatemalan
roots. If you dig through a pile of junk, you're "rooting around."

ascending

Восходящий

verb
 1. взойти (ascend, rise, mount)
 2. подниматься (lift, rise, climb, raise, get up, up)
 3. восходить (ascend, rise, go up, go back, date back, mount)
 4. всходить (rise, ascend, mount, come up, braird, spring)
 5. набирать высоту (climb, ascend)
 6. вести происхождение (ascend, come)
 7. продвигаться (advance, push, get ahead, carry forward, rise, get along)

If something is ascending, it's rising or moving up. At a hot air
balloon race, you'll see dozens of ascending balloons.

An ascending road appears to rise in front of you as it curves up over
a hill, and an ascending bird flies up into the sky. To ascend is to
rise, and the adjective ascending describes a rising or growing thing.
You can also use it figuratively: "She's an ascending queen, rising to
the throne after the death of her father." In Latin, ascendere, "to
climb up," and also "to rise" or "to reach."

Your task is to sort ascending odd numbers but even numbers must
      be on their places.
* Participle :Study:

Причастие

noun
 1. причастие (Communion, participle, Sacrament, Eucharist, element, Lord's Supper)
 2. деепричастие (participle)


A participle is a verb that acts like an adjective, like a running
leap, scorned lover, or boiled egg.

This is a technical word that will come up when you're studying
grammar or linguistics. From a Greek root meaning “partaker,” a
participle wants to partake of both the verb and adjective worlds. If
you said, "I need a running start!" before a race, running is a
participle. If you notice a trapped bear, trapped is the participle.
This is a word that is a little confusing to understand, even though
you use participles all the time.


* kettle :Study:

чайник

noun
 1. чайник (kettle, teapot, pot, teakettle)

 3. котелок (bowler, pot, kettle, bowler hat, derby, cauldron)
 4. металлический чайник (kettle)
 5. бадья (tub, bucket, kibble, pail, skip, kettle)
 6. коробка компаса (kettle)


A kettle is a pot made for boiling water. Most kettles are metal, with
a lid and a spout. If you're in the mood for a cup of tea, it might be
time to "put the kettle on."

You can use the word kettle to mean "metal cooking pot," although it's
mostly used for the kind you use to make your tea or instant soup. If
you want to comment on the incredible awkwardness of a situation, you
can use the colloquial phrase, "Well, this is a fine kettle of fish,"
and if you criticize a friend for something you're also guilty of, she
might say, "That's the pot calling the kettle black!"

Waiting for John, the kettle boiled.

Think it might be fun to be a party planner? These highly organized
people arrange everything from invitations to music, food, even the
lighting in the room, meaning they put everything in order.

At a concert, you look in your program to see what piece is next.
There's a title, followed by the composer's name. Under that is
another name, preceded by "arranged by." What does that mean? Every
piece was originally written with a certain instrument or instruments
in mind. In order for that music to be played by other instruments, it
first has to be adapted, meaning someone has to arrange it. A symphony
for kazoos? You can arrange that.

Wanting to speak to him about the contract, I decided to arrange

 3. настоящий (present, real, true, actual, genuine, veritable)

 6. чистопородный (genuine, clean-bred)

Genuine things are true or authentic. When you're talking about
people, being genuine has to do with being sincere.

This word has to do with things and people that are true. A genuine
blonde is a real blonde — no hair dye involved. A genuine friend is a
real friend you can trust when the chips are down. Genuine feelings
are real feelings — not fake feelings put on as a show. A genuine
hundred dollar bill is the real McCoy, not a counterfeit bill. When
something is the real thing, it's genuine.

Небеса

noun
 1. небо (sky, heaven, palate, blue, roof of the mouth, sphere)
 2. небеса (heaven, sky, empyrean, ether, sphere)
 3. бог (god, deity, heaven, divinity, almighty, king)
 4. провидение (providence, heaven)

Heaven is a place that seems absolutely perfect in every way. You can
think of it as the lofty heavens up above, or as a place of
everlasting bliss.

The places you think of as heaven could also be called "paradise" or
"Eden." All of these words are based on a religious idea of heaven as
a perfect, blissful existence that's granted to good people after they
die. This spiritual heaven is generally depicted as the place where
God lives, and is commonly described as being high in the sky. In
fact, the original meaning of the Old English heaven, heofon, was
"sky."

 4. придавать запах (flavor, tincture, flavour)
 5. придавать интерес (flavor, season, zest, flavour)
 6. придавать пикантность (flavor, sauce, spice, salt, season, zest)


Flavor is the way something tastes. If an ice cream shop offers 50
flavors, each one of them will taste different.

The flavor of your soup can be adjusted by adding salt — and when you
add ingredients to change a food's taste, you can say you flavor it.
From the flavor of food comes the sense of flavor meaning "atmosphere"
or "feeling." You could say, for example, that you're not crazy about
a particular clothing shop because it has such a glitzy, expensive
flavor. Flavor initially meant "smell," from the Vulgar Latin flator,
"odor."

* impose :Study:

11. заключать (conclude, enclose, infer, include, establish, impose)
12. обманом продать (impose)
13. впечатлять (impress, make an impression, impose)

To impose means to force or inflict something on someone else. If you
want to impose your musical taste on your parents, play your tunes all
day at top volume.

The verb impose emerged in the 1580s, meaning "to lay on as a burden,"
which is very similar to the modern meaning. Governments often impose
taxes, legal restrictions, and other burdensome things on citizens,
for example. But you should remember what Confucius once wisely said:
"Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire."

* clarification :Study:

 3. осветление (clarification, defecation)
 4. очищение (purification, purifying, clarification, refinement, purgation, purge)
 5. очистка (cleaning, purification, clearing, clearance, refining, clarification)


Clarification is what you hope to achieve when you make an idea or
concept less confusing and easier to understand. This often happens
after a detailed or very clear explanation.

Loudspeaker announcements in bus terminals and train stations are
always so muffled and difficult to understand that it would be nice if
you could at least find someone afterward who could provide
clarification. In the realm of science, clarification is also the act
of removing solid particles from a liquid so that it is more pure and,
in some cases, so that it is transparent.

 5. обрабатывать флюсом (flux)
 6. отшлаковать (flux)
 7. очищать (clean, purify, cleanse, clear, peel, flux)
 8. давать слабительное (purge, flux)

The noun flux describes something that constantly changes. If your
likes, dislikes, attitudes, dreams, and even friends are changing all
the time, you may be in flux.

Flux can also mean being unsure about a decision. Suppose you just had
a great job interview and suddenly your friend invites you to go to
Australia with her. You don't know what to do because you don't want
to miss a call about the job — or Sydney! You're in flux until you
hear from the potential employer. Another kind of flux is liquid
moving or flowing, like the flux of water under a sheet of melting
ice.

* crucial :Study:

ключевой

adjective
 1. решающий (decisive, crucial, critical, final, winning, determinative)
 2. критический (critical, crucial, critic, pointed, climacteric)
 3. ключевой (key, crucial)
 4. крестообразный (cruciate, cruciform, crucial)

The word crucial describes something that is important or essential to
success, like the crucial dress rehearsals that ensure everything will
run smoothly on your play's opening night.

Usage experts insist that the word crucial should be used only to
describe something that is truly critical for solving a problem or for
resolving a situation, such as a crucial vote that determines a final
outcome. In this case the crucial vote is decisive: it determines the
outcome. But the word has gained popularity as a way to say that
something is important. You might hear someone say, for example, that
it is crucial to allow employees to vote on the new schedule to make
them feel like they’re part of the process. In this case the sense is
“important”: nothing decisive is taking place.

 6. осмеливаться (presume, hazard, adventure)

If you presume something, it means you act as though it's true before
all the evidence is in. If you are presumed to be the fastest runner,
don't get too cocky — that word implies that you haven't actually
raced yet.

To presume is to take something for granted. The famous quote “Dr.
Livingstone, I presume?” comes from the explorer Henry Morton Stanley,
who ran into the explorer David Livingstone in the wilds of Africa in
1871. It’s funny because these were the only two white men known to be
in that part of Africa at the time.

 2. возможность (opportunity, possibility, potential, capacity, ability, chance)
 3. умение (skill, ability, knack, art, proficiency, capability)
 4. ловкость (agility, dexterity, skill, knack, sleight, ability)
 5. дарование (gift, endowment, ability, faculty)
 6. компетенция (competence, competency, expertise, terms of reference, scope, ability)

Ability is skill or talent. You might have the ability to blow
bubbles, or sing in a falsetto, or dance the waltz. Or, just maybe,
you have the ability to do all three things at once. Impressive!

From the Old French ablate "expert at handling (something)," and that
from the Latin habilitatem, "aptitude," comes the English ability, a
noun indicating the power to act, perform, or accomplish. Capacity is
similar in meaning to ability, but note that people have a capacity
for doing something, and an ability to do something.


* possibility :Study:

noun
 1. возможность (opportunity, possibility, potential, capacity, ability, chance)
 2. вероятность (probability, likelihood, chance, possibility, credibility, likeliness)
 3. перспектива (prospect, perspective, outlook, vista, possibility, promise)

If something could realistically happen, it's a possibility. So
winning the lottery is a slight possibility, but becoming king of the
world is not even a remote possibility.

In one sense, a possibility is an option: "One possibility is that the
UFO is just a shooting star." It can also mean more of a potential:
"This house might look like an abandoned shack, but it's got so much
possibility!" All meanings of possibility share the sense that
something is able to happen, or is possible. The Latin root is
possibilis, "that can be done."

 4. жидкий (liquid, fluid, runny, thin, watery, fluent)
 5. гладкий (smooth, sleek, plain, slick, polished, fluent)
 6. владеющий речью (fluent)

To be fluent in something — like a language or an instrument — is to
be able to use it smoothly and effortlessly.

It takes many years and lots of practice to become fluent in a second
language. But when you're finally fluent, you can understand it, speak
it, and write easily in it. One French class won't make you fluent —
gaining fluency takes years. You can also be fluent in other things
that you've practiced and mastered, like cello or computer
programming. If you're doing something in a way that makes it look
easy, you're fluent.

Occasion means something special––that happens seldom or is notable
when it does. On occasion, we sit down together as a family, but not
every day, and never for dinner. When Great Aunt Mabel visits,
however, we rise to the occasion and stage a large family meal.

Occasion can also mean a designated time or reason something happens,
or it can be an event in itself. I'm giving you your grandmother's
ring on the occasion of your graduation from high school. I haven't
had occasion to look at it since she died. It's valuable, so only wear
it on special occasions.

Use the word burglar when you're talking about someone who steals
things from inside a house or a building.

A burglar often breaks a window or forces a lock, intending to take
valuable items. The act of doing this is burglary, and to do it is to
burglarize in the United States, or to burgle in Britain. In the
1540's, burglar was a short form of the word burglator, from the Latin
burgare, "to break open."

verb
 1. облачать (vest, invest, enrobe, garb, array, habit)
 2. одевать (dress, wear, clothe, tog, clad, habit)

Any action that you perform regularly as part of your routine can be
called a habit. Flossing your teeth would be considered a good habit.
Sucking your thumb would be considered a bad habit, especially as an
adult.

On New Year's people always vow to break their bad habits, but bad
habits die hard. The noun habit can also refer to an established
custom — like the habit of breaking bread with your family every
holiday. On a completely different note, clothing that is worn for
horseback riding, or by a nun or monk, can also be called a habit. All
good nuns should be in the habit of washing their habits.

To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean
to go or to plan to go, especially to a certain destination, as in
being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

Superman can "leap tall buildings in a single bound," but the word
bound is usually about boundaries. When you're playing soccer or
football, the ball goes "out of bounds." Someone can also be bound
with rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you get
married, you're bound to your partner. If you make a promise, you're
bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're constipated,
you're bound up.

Doubt is distrust or suspicion. When your kid sister explains that a
robber broke in and ate your entire chocolate stash, most likely you
feel doubt.

When you're in doubt, you really can't tell what's true and what's
false, whether that's a news story or whether you want to marry
someone or whether you'll survive Med school. The Latin root of doubt
is dubitāre, "to hesitate, waver," and when you doubt something you're
wavering: I think I believe you, but maybe I don't. But maybe I do.
But maybe not? One thing not to doubt is the silent b. Pronounce:

Прогнозирования

verb
 1. предсказывать (predict, prophesy, forecast, foretell, divine, soothsay)

To predict is to say what you think is going to happen in the future.
If you predict that you'll win the poker championship, you're either
really confident in your poker skills or you're cheating.

The prefix pre means "before." Dict comes from the Latin dicere, which
means "to say", yet you can use predict to refer to things that can't
say anything at all. Darkening skies can predict a coming storm, for
example, and a runny nose can predict a cold. You can predict
something based on factual evidence, or on a crystal-ball reading, or
just on plain intuition.

noun
 1. великий пост (lent, Quadragesima)

DEFINITION

suffix
 1. (forming adjectives) full of; characterized by.
    "pestilent"


When you lend something, you loan it or let someone borrow it. You
might, for example, lend your bike to your brother — if he promises to
be careful with it.

Libraries lend people books, and car rental companies lend people cars
— in both cases, the item that's been borrowed is supposed to be
returned eventually. Another way to lend is to "add a quality to," or
"be suitable for." You could say that you think your hat lends you a
mysterious quality, or that your trench coat lends itself to walking
through a foggy city at dusk.

 5. пожинать плоды (reap, harvest)

adjective
 1. связанный с урожаем (harvest)

The harvest is the time when you reap what you sow. As a verb, to
harvest something means that you pick or gather it. You might harvest
your sweet corn late in the summer.

As a noun, harvest means the time of year when crops are ripe and
ready to be gathered. The picked crop is also called a harvest: a
bumper crop is a plentiful harvest, and a poor harvest is when things
didn’t grow as well as expected. As a verb, to harvest something is to
gather, trap, or cull it. You can harvest a soybean crop, you can
harvest beaver pelts, or you can harvest tissues or organs for
transplants.

Denote comes from the Latin root dēnotāre, "to mark out." Using a
particular facial expression can denote meaning, as in, "All of the
crinkled foreheads and squinted eyebrows denoted a lack of
understanding among the math students." Words and symbols also point
to, or denote, meaning, "If he had used PST to denote the fact that he

If you have a keen interest in something, you are really, really into
it. Keen is an adjective that describes something that is intense,
sharp, or focused.

The adjective keen comes from the Old English word cene that
translates to "bold and brave" and while the spelling is now really
different, the sounds are similar. Variations of keen as being "bold"
and "strong" show up in other languages like Old Norse, German, Dutch,
but apparently only English has the meaning of "sharp" — relating to
"an edge or blade." Keen has a lot of close — and brutal — synonyms,
such as caustic, cutting, piercing, and penetrating!

With eager, think "ready," "excited," "can't wait." An eager beaver is
someone who, like the hard working beaver, is up at dawn and ready to
get to work.

Eager derives from old words meaning "sharp, pungent or keen," and
eager carries that sense of sharpness still. In fact, being overeager
is a criticism; someone overeager is likely to make a mistake because
they are moving too quickly or not thinking things through before they
act.

The oldest meaning of appreciate is "to know the worth of something":
"The parolee appreciated his newfound freedom." A related sense is "to
be grateful for something," but this usage can sound wordy. Instead of
"I would appreciate your sending me more information," consider:
"Please send me more information." The word can also be used (without
a direct object) to mean "to rise in worth": "The vintage Corvette
would appreciate in value over the years."

winter coat and your insulated hood for scuba diving. Other things
with a similar protective quality are also called hoods, like the
metal vent cover over your stove, the cover on your car's engine, and

You can also say you tend something if you care for it. You have to
tend a vegetable garden, for example, if you expect to harvest more
vegetables than weeds. If you are inclined to do something, then you
tend to do that thing. You might tend to let your homework go until

 5. фактор, оказывающее влияние (influence)

verb
 1. оказывать влияние (influence, bias, operate, reach, exert one's influence)
 2. влиять (influence, affect, act, manipulate, exert, weigh)

Influence is the power to have an important effect on someone or
something. If someone influences someone else, they are changing a
person or thing in an indirect but important way.

Sometimes a person who influences another doesn't intend to have any
effect, but sometimes they are using influence to benefit themselves.
An example of a personal benefit or advantage would be the use of
political influence. Influence is also a verb, from Latin influere to
flow in.

14. губить (destroy, ruin, kill, perish, undo, overwhelm)
15. поражать (hit, smite, amaze, affect, strike, overwhelm)

Overwhelm means “give a person too much of something.” If your friend
agrees to feed your pet fish while you’re on vacation, don’t overwhelm
her with requests by also asking her to do your laundry and wash the
dishes.

While it’s easy to be overwhelmed by chores or complaints, it’s also
possible to be overwhelmed by good things — if they occur in large
quantities. You might enjoy a stack of pancakes for breakfast, but
you'd probably find a truckload of pancakes overwhelming. Sometimes
people feel overwhelmed by emotion, and this can be a positive or
negative experience, depending on the emotion. For example, you might
feel overwhelmed by gratitude if your friend takes excellent care of
your fish, but overwhelmed with grief if the fish is accidentally
flushed in your absence.

a defense lawyer.

Defense is the opposite of offense. It has to do with defending
against all sorts of things: In the military, defense is about
protecting a country from attack. In sports, defense is supposed to
stop the other team from scoring. A defense attorney tries to prove
his client is innocent. A defense can even be an excuse for doing
something, as in "In my own defense, I was sleepwalking at the time."

suffering from mental illness, which is very serious. When someone
commits a crime, it's important to know if they were sane or insane.
If they're insane, the penalty is different. Many uses of the word are
not so serious. A wild party is called insane, and car salesmen say
their prices are insane. A teacher assigning six hours of homework

 2. ранимый (vulnerable)

Use the adjective vulnerable to describe something or someone open to
being physically or emotionally wounded, like a newborn chick or an
overly sensitive teenager.

Vulnerable is from Latin and is based on vulnus "wound." From its
literal meaning, it has come to be more often used for someone who is
easily hurt or likely to succumb to temptation. It's best used for a
person whose feelings are so delicate that they can't withstand any
criticism or pressure: "Don't speak harshly to her, she's very

 8. оцепенелый (numb, benumbed, dead, stupid)

noun
 1. дурак (fool, stupid, idiot, goof, mutt, softy)

A stupid person doesn’t have much intelligence or imagination, and
they go through life making decisions that seem to lack all common
sense. If you’ve got a brain but you don’t use it, you might be a bit
stupid.

The word comes from a Latin adjective that means “amazed or stunned,”
and stupid people are stunned by everything because their minds are
numb. You can make a stupid mistake when you’re not thinking, and you
can call someone stupid if you’re feeling cruel, like “Hey, Stupid.”
Zombies are stupid because their brains are dead. If that makes sense
to you, then you’re not stupid, and you’re also not a zombie. Well
done!

While "stupid" doesn't mean "impossible", invading Estonia and Poland would
be lunacy beyond comprehension, on so many levels.

 2. похожий (similar, like, resembling, alike, akin, twin)
 3. сродный (akin, affined)
 4. такой же как (akin)

If two things are akin, then they're similar or related. A cupcake is
akin to a cake and relatives are akin to each other.

If you know the word kin — a relative — then you have a clue to the
meaning of akin. People who are related are akin, but the word goes
beyond blood relations. Football is akin to the sport of rugby;
baseball is akin to the British sport cricket. Mice are akin to rats,
and rats are akin to gerbils, hamsters, and squirrels. Things that are

Fossils are the really, really old remains of a plant or animal — so
old they've turned to stone. Fossil is also an insult for an old or
old-fashioned person.

Fossils are very important to scientists who study animals: they're
one of the ways we learn about the beasts and critters of the past. A
fossil is an imprint of the bones of that animal in rock or stone. If
you see a reconstruction of a dinosaur in a museum, scientists used
fossils to figure out how it should look. Also, calling someone a
fossil is like calling them a geezer or old fogey. It's not a
compliment.

The world is moving away from fossil fuels.

go.

Fuel can also act as a verb that has several different meanings, all
related to stimulating something or providing energy. Your brother
might fuel up on whole-wheat bread with peanut butter a few hours
before a big game. A teacher assigns readings to fuel meaningful class

A profit is money you make, as opposed to money you lose. Also,
anything good profits you — it benefits you.

When we talk about profits, we're talking about coming out ahead.
Businesses need to make a profit — money — or they'll have to fire
employees, cut expenses, and maybe go out of business entirely. If
more money is coming in than going out, that's a profit. Profit also
means a benefit. For example, you could profit from playing baseball
even if you made no money from it. Getting exercise and fun would
profit anybody quite a bit.

Дверной звонок

noun
 1. дверной звонок (doorbell)

A doorbell is a signal that a visitor can use to let you know they're
at your door. Most doorbells have a small button that rings a bell
inside the house when it's pushed.

Your doorbell might emit a long chiming ring, even playing part of a
song, or it may make a harsh buzzing sound. Doorbells tend to be
louder than a simple knock on the door, and often they can be heard
throughout a house or apartment. The very first doorbells were

Many people use the expression "enhance your chance" to point out ways
to increase your chances of winning or earning a contest or prize.
When you enhance something, you heighten it or make it better.

"Hance" is not a word, but the addition of "en-" does something to
enhance it and improve its sound. You can enhance the size of
something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word
original meant (the "hance" part came via French from Latin altus,
meaning "high"). When you enhance something you take it to a higher
level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or adding
words to enhance your vocabulary.

noun
 1. целое (whole, integer, unit, entire, all, total)
 2. полнота (completeness, fullness, fulness, entirety, plenitude, entire)
 3. некастрированное животное (entire)


Think of the word entire as referring to all of anything. Now think of
that "all" as being whole — not broken or lacking in any way. Remember
that, and you will have the entire meaning of the word.

Entire is based on the Latin integrum, which came from the prefix in-,
"not," and tangere, "to touch," and thus means "untouched." From there
it developed into the 14th-century Old French entier, meaning
"unbroken or complete," and then, through Middle English, into our
modern word entire. One use of the word you don't see every day is to
describe an uncastrated horse — an "entire horse" is a stallion. Gives

16. втравливать (inveigle, draw, involve)

To involve means to connect. When you get involved in the Spanish
Club, you attend meetings and events. If doing math well is involved
in understanding advanced chemistry, that means it's a necessary part
of it.

When someone is very involved, it means they are engaged or connected
to a lot of activities. When someone is self-involved, all they
connect with is him or herself. If getting ice cream involves walking
a mile to the ice cream shop, the exercise offsets the indulgence.
When no exercise is involved, it's less healthy.

Chickenpox is a very contagious illness that causes fevers and a
spotty rash. It used to be common for almost every child to get
chickenpox at some point.

Today a vaccine protects kids from getting chickenpox — and though
it's thought of as a mild childhood disease, it can be serious or even
deadly. Once you've had chickenpox, or the series of shots, you're
immune from getting it again. The origin of chickenpox is uncertain:
it may come from the resemblance of the rash to tiny chickpeas, or
chicken pecks. Alternately, the chicken may refer to "children," or be
a contrast to the more serious smallpox.

you'd better not count on an unreliable person. People can be
unreliable because they're dishonest, always late, bad at their job,

saying goes, "Give someone a fish, they eat for a day, teach someone
to fish and they eat for a lifetime." I hope they like seafood.

The Old English word tǣcan, which became the Middle English techen,
meant "to show or point out." But the Old English also had another
word for teach — læran — which eventually became the modern "learn,"
with the current meaning of receiving knowledge rather than giving it.
If someone tries to "teach you a lesson," he or she tries to punish
you for something you've done in order that you won't do it again.

 noun

 Reciprocal describes something that's the same on both sides. If you

 resolve it through a reciprocal agreement that you'll stop poking her
 and she'll stop reading road signs out loud.

 The word mutual is a near synonym in most uses: reciprocal/mutual
 friendship, describing, a relationship in which two people feel the
 same way about each other, or do or give similar things to each other.
 If you tell someone you like them and they say, "The feelings are
 reciprocal," that means they like you too. In math, a reciprocal is a
 number that when multiplied by a given number gives one as a product.

 9. все-таки (nevertheless, though, still)

adverb
 1. однако (however, though, nevertheless, still, even so, notwithstanding)
 2. все же (still, yet, though, nonetheless, even so)

 Though is fine conjunction. It's no "but" or "however", though it is a
 useful word, when you want let a reader know that two ideas are
 opposing one another.

 There are two basic kinds of the so-called coordinating conjunctions:
 those that connect similar thoughts — for example, "and" — and those
 that disconnect similar thoughts — for instance, "but" and "however."
 Though fits into the second category. For example "Though Prince is
 considered 'older' by rock-star standards, his concerts put those of
 most kids half his age to shame." The "though" in that sentence gets
 its power from the comma at the midpoint, because that's where the two
 opposing ideas meet. The word Though at the beginning tells us to look
 for that comma.

 Again, there is
     no difference in meaning between these, though

 A reduced thing has been lessened or subtracted from. If you want to
 ride your bike in Italy and you’re on a budget, look for reduced
 airfare. For a reduced risk of injury, wear a helmet when you get
 there.

 To reduce something is to make it smaller or lessen it in some way.
 Therefore, anything reduced is smaller than it was before. If you’re
 pedaling your way through Italy and hit a giant hill, you’ll probably
 have reduced pedal power and go much slower. This word applies to
 things that are going down in degree or amount. There could be reduced
 pain, reduced cost, or reduced size. Anything described as reduced can
 also be called decreased.

 could result in a crash that causes injury.

 Injury often refers to physical damage, but it can be used more
 figuratively to describe something that's unjust or that causes harm
 that isn't physical. For example, your estranged grandfather might do
 you the injury of leaving you out of his will. The word injury comes
 from the Latin in-, meaning “not,” and jus or jur, meaning “right.” So
 an injury is something that's not right — it's something that has gone
 wrong that leads to damage.

verb
 1. пропускать (miss, skip, pass, overlook, miss out, omit)
 2. не включать (omit, leave out)
 3. упускать (miss, lose, neglect, omit, leave out, let go)
 4. пренебрегать (neglect, flout, disregard, ignore, disdain, defy)

 If you omit one member of the class when you're handing out
 valentines, it's going to make that person feel terrible. To omit
 something is to leave it out, to forget or overlook it.

 The verb omit comes from the Latin word omittere, "to let go or to lay
 aside," which is exactly what it means. When you omit an ingredient
 you need for your brownie recipe from the grocery list, you've
 accidentally left off an important item. You can also deliberately
 omit something, which you'd do if you didn't include your least
 favorite cousin when you invited your relatives to a family reunion.

 If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb then it can be
     omitted

 When you say something out loud, that's speech. When you give a
 speech, you say a lot of things in front of a group. Maybe you should
 open with a joke?

 The ability to produce and understand speech in complex ways has long
 been considered part of what separates humans from other animals.
 "Freedom of speech" is the right to express your thoughts and opinions
 publicly. Adjectives, nouns and verbs are "parts of speech." By the
 way: speech is a noun.

 family about who gets to read a book first.

 The adjective form of frequent also means regularly and often
 encountered. If you live on the windward side of Oahu, Hawaii, you may
 experience frequent rain showers. As a verb, frequent means to be a
 regular visitor or to patronize. You can frequent the trails of the
 National Parks. You may prefer to frequent locally-owned businesses.

 1. богохульство (blasphemy, profanity, oath, swear)

 Saying offensive things about God or religion is blasphemy. Blasphemy
 can be used for offensive ideas in other areas too.

 If you're saying something bad about a god, or taking the Lord's name
 in vain, or questioning a religious institution in any way, you could
 be accused of blasphemy — insulting something sacred. You can use this
 word in a lot of other ways too. At a meeting of conservatives, a
 liberal idea could be considered blasphemy (and vice versa). You might
 even jokingly cry "Blasphemy!" if a friend said your favorite ice
 cream flavor stinks.

 If someone is said to be allegedly guilty of something, it means that
 proof has yet to be produced or they have yet to be found formally
 guilty by law.

 Allegedly is used almost entirely in a legal sense, referring to a
 potentially criminal action that is being or will shortly be decided
 in court. (It's from the medieval English word allege, meaning
 "quoted" or "brought forth in court.") For less serious matters, such
 as whether or not your boyfriend called you a liar, the word

 wicked
 [ˈwikid]
 злой

 adjective
  1. злой (evil, wicked, ill, vicious, unkind, sinister)
  2. безнравственный (immoral, wicked, licentious, unprincipled, bad, unmoral)
  3. грешный (sinful, wicked, unhallowed, erring, peccant, peccable)
  4. нехороший (bad, wicked, black-hearted)
  5. озорной (mischievous, naughty, wicked, sly, gamine, prankish)
  6. испорченный (spoiled, depraved, tainted, damaged, corrupt, wicked)

 13. замечательный (remarkable, wonderful, great, admirable, marvelous, wicked)
 14. плутовской (picaresque, wicked, puckish)

 Wicked has two quite contradictory meanings. If something is pure
 evil, then it is wicked. Think Darth Vader. On the other hand, as an
 informal slang term, wicked also means excellent — as in "that DJ is
 wicked, man!" Go figure.

 Other shades of meaning for wicked include something that is playful
 or enjoyably malicious. Someone might have a wicked sense of humor,
 for example, meaning it's fierce and takes aim sharply at its victims.
 Or it can also mean something that, while not actively evil, is still
 extremely unpleasant. Exams can be wicked, and so can someone's temper
 or the weather. The word comes from the Old English term wicca meaning
 "wizard."

 verb
  1. соблазнять (tempt, seduce, lure, entice, allure, court)
  2. совратить (seduce)
  3. совращать (seduce, pervert, abuse, debauch)
  4. обольщать (seduce, flatter, debauch, inveigle, blandish)

 To seduce is to lure or entice, particularly away from obligations or
 proper behavior. Often, seducing leads to sex.

 Seduce means something close to attract, beguile, tempt, and mislead:
 a beautiful woman could seduce a dude, and a clever criminal could
 seduce the same dude into a life of crime. A gorgeous day could seduce
 you from doing your homework. When you're being seduced, it implies
 you're being tricked a little bit, often into something that's
 enticing but not so good. The word is used in a famous line from The
 Graduate: “Mrs. Robinson, you’re trying to seduce me.”

 adjective
  1. утомительный (tedious, tiring, tiresome, exhausting, weary, fatiguing)

  3. скучный (boring, dull, tedious, blah, uninspired, tiresome)
  4. муторный (dreary, tedious, drear)

 If something is tedious, it's boring. If you're anxious to get outside
 and enjoy the sun, even the best lecture will seem tedious.

 Tedious is the adjective from tedium, which is both Latin and English
 for boredom. You ordinarily wouldn't use tedious for people, just
 things; you might say "His speeches are tedious," but usually not "He
 is tedious." Something that is tedious could also be called tiresome.
 Shakespeare's Friar Laurence says "I will be brief, for my short date
 of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale."

 adjective

  2. сжатый (compressed, short, concise, tight, succinct, brief)
  3. опоясанный (girded, belted, begirt, succinct, zoned)

 Something that is succinct is short and clear. If you're going to be
 interviewed on television about your new book and only have a five
 minute slot, you'll need to come up with a succinct version of your
 story.

 Succinct, meaning "short and to the point," is from the Latin
 succingere, "to tuck up." Often after you write a long essay, you
 realize you probably could have said the same thing in one or two
 succinct pages. If something is too succinct, we might call it terse.
 Another synonym is concise, which implies that unnecessary material
 has been removed. It's the opposite of wordy.

 For complex matching and manipulation, regular expressions offer

 adjective
  1. предшествующий (previous, prior, preceding, foregoing, antecedent, anterior)

 Something is preceding if it comes directly before. The preceding
 sentence is not so much a definition of the word preceding as a
 description of it.

 To cede is to give way, so when you use preceding to describe, say, a
 person, you’re essentially describing him as the one that just gave
 way. Previous is a good synonyms. If you are in 11th grade now, you

 бунт

 noun
  1. мятеж (rebellion, mutiny, revolt, insurgency, insurrection, riot)
  2. бунт (revolt, rebellion, riot, mutiny, insurrection)
  3. восстание (insurrection, uprising, rebellion, revolt, rising, mutiny)

 verb
  1. взбунтоваться (mutiny)
  2. поднимать мятеж (mutiny)

 A mutiny is a rebellion against authority, like when sailors overthrow
 the captain of a ship or when a class of 8th graders refuses to
 dissect a frog in biology class.

 Mutiny comes from an old verb, mutine, which means "revolt," and a
 mutiny is still like a revolt. It can be a group of people, like in
 the famous Mutiny on the Bounty in 1789 when the crew of a British
 Royal Navy ship kicked the captain out so they could stay in Tahiti.
 (Totally worth it.) A mutiny doesn't have to be at sea or in the
 military; it can be to "refuse the order of the person in authority,"
 in other words, every teacher's nightmare.

 Now, every year, there’s at least one class that decides a mutiny is their
 best possible way of either breaking me or granting them no classwork.

 The mutiny was led by the Alexey Navalniy.

  2. вести артиллерийский огонь (barrage)
  3. ставить заграждения (barrage)

 A barrage is something that comes quickly and heavily — as an attack
 of bullets or artillery, or a fast spray of words.

 Sometimes in movies or news footage, the audience gets a glimpse from
 behind a mounted weapon and sees a heavy rain of bombs or bullets —
 called a barrage — going toward a target, sending as much POW! as
 possible to hit a wide area. Words become a barrage when spoken or
 written in uncontrollable anger or with overflowing emotion: "Her
 human-rights speech was a barrage of passion. It was hard to keep up
 with, but we felt the intensity of her cause."

 verb
  1. выпалить (blurt out, blurt, fire off, touch off, let off, go off)
  2. сболтнуть (blurt, blurt out, cough up)

 If you blurt something out, you're speaking abruptly and without
 thinking about what you're saying.

 Usually, when you blurt something, you end up regretting it. Saying
 something without considering your words can end up making you feel
 stupid or hurting someone's feelings — just imagine what might happen
 if you were to blurt out what you really think about your
 grandmother's cooking. The best thing about the word blurt is that
 it's onomatopoeic, or a word that sounds exactly like what it means.

 One day when I as substituting, a boy in the class got mad at something the
 girl blurted out in class.

 or the members of the marching band who stand at the rear of the
 parade.

 At the other end of something's front is its rear, whether it's a car
 or a line of people standing outside a theater. You can also use rear
 informally to mean "bottom" or "hindquarters," as an adjective meaning
 "toward the back," or as a verb: "The horses started to rear up on
 their back legs." The verb comes from a Germanic root meaning "to
 raise," while the noun is rooted in the Latin retro, "behind."

 My shock at the cruelty of the statement made my

 silence so people can concentrate. To silence someone is to hush him
 up or tell him to be quiet. Silence also has a more disturbing

 underlying

 лежащий в основе

 adjective
  1. основной (main, basic, base, primary, key, underlying)
  2. лежащий в основе (underlying, basal, subjacent)
  3. лежащий или расположенный под (underlying)


 The obvious meaning of underlying refers to something beneath
 something else. But the word carries a more subtle meaning, that of
 something hidden but important, something that shapes the meaning or
 effect of something else, without being explicit itself.

 Consider the adjective underlying as referring to a "subtext," which
 is something hidden. An example is sarcasm, when a person says one
 thing but means the opposite. In theater, an actor develops subtext
 for his or her character to establish an underlying reason for what
 that character says and does. Life is full of underlying reasons we do
 things. Worry over a grandparent's illness might be the underlying
 reason a child fails a test. (Then again, maybe she just didn't
 study.)

 explicitly

 эксплицитно

 adverb
  1. эксплицитно (explicitly)
  2. ясно (clear, plain, explicitly, expressly, distinctly, obviously)
  3. недвусмысленно (explicitly, in so many words)
  4. точно (exactly, precisely, accurately, just, for sure, explicitly)

 When you explain something explicitly, you do it in great detail,
 leaving no room for misunderstanding. You could intimidate your little
 brother by explicitly describing what you'll do if he reads your
 diary.

 Something that's said or done explicitly is clear and direct, like an
 explicitly told story about terrible poverty in India — it leaves out
 no disturbing details, even if it upsets the listener. Explicitly can
 also refer to sexual situations or details, like a movie whose sex
 scenes are shown explicitly, or graphically. The Latin root is
 explicare, "unfold, unravel, explain."

 злонамеренный

 adjective
  1. злонамеренный (malicious, evil, evil-minded)
  2. злобный (vicious, malicious, spiteful, malevolent, catty, hateful)
  3. ехидный (malicious, spiteful, viperous)
  4. умышленный (deliberate, intentional, willful, voluntary, purposeful, malicious)

 Someone who is malicious enjoys hurting or embarrassing others. If
 you're writing a book about good and evil, you'll want to come up with
 a truly malicious character to do all the bad stuff.

 Malicious is the adjective based on the noun malice, which means the
 desire to harm others. Both words come from the Latin word malus, for
 bad. If someone is malicious he doesn't just make bad things happen;
 he loves to make bad things happen.

 There was no malicious intent at all.

 собранный

 adjective
  1. собранный (assembled, collected, gathered, picked, together, accumulated)
  2. смонтированный (mounted, assembled)

 To assemble means to bring together, as in people or parts. The
 volunteers assembled to assemble the bikes for the needy kids.

 The U.S. Constitution guarantees in something in the Bill of Rights
 called "the right of assembly." This means that people are allowed to
 come together for any purpose they chose. In countries without this

 accompanying

 сопровождая

 adjective
  1. сопровождающий (accompanying, attendant, concomitant)
  2. сопутствующий (concomitant, accompanying, attendant)

 Someone or something that goes along with something else is
 accompanying. You might send an email with an accompanying photograph
 of your new puppy, for example.

 Accompanying is related to company or companion. So think of the word
 as being about keeping someone or something else company, of being its
 companion or its friend. If you are accompanying, then the main focus
 is not on you. A report on animal abuse may give us all the grim facts
 we need to know, but the accompanying pictures bring it all home.

 Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system, such as
     X11, Mir or a Wayland implementation, and an accompanying desktop

     such as LXDE or Xfce.

 mainstream

 Основной поток

 noun
  1. основное направление (mainstream)
  2. главная линия (mainstream, trunk)


 Mainstream describes what's viewed by most people in a society as
 "normal," like the mainstream view that everyone should get married,
 move to the suburbs, and have children as soon as they can.

 Something that's mainstream is conventional, or the usual way of doing
 things. If you're talking about the mainstream in fashion, you mean
 the ordinary clothes that most people wear and which is found in all
 the malls — nothing too weird or outlandish. In the 1600s, mainstream
 described the prevailing current of a river, with the first recorded
 use of its meaning of prevailing taste or opinion in 1831.

 Some of the most popular mainstream Linux
     distributions are Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora,
     Gentoo Linux, Linux Mint, Mageia, openSUSE and Ubuntu, together
     with commercial distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and
     SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

 Those who are not in the mainstream of public opinion often find their
 views ignored by the majority.

 подробный

 adjective
  1. многословный (verbose, wordy, prolix, lengthy, mouthy, redundant)

 If you're verbose, you use far more words than you need to. A verbose
 book report goes on and on and is packed with long, complicated words
 that aren't at all necessary.

 If a friend asks, "Did you have fun at the party?" you can simply
 answer, "No." Or you can provide a verbose reply that describes just
 how much you hated the party, who was and wasn't there, the fact that
 you got lost on the way, the terrible food that was served, and the
 awful music that was played. Verbose is from Latin verbosus "full of
 words," from verbum, "word or verb." As you can guess from the
 spelling, the English verb is closely related.

 The parameters are 'x' to extract files, 'z' to filter through gzip
     for decompression (leave this off if the file does not have a gz
     extension), 'v' for verbose mode so you can tell what’s going on, f
     indicating there will be a filename to follow

 My verbose friend could talk for hours with no stop.

 noun
  1. заклинание (spell, incantation, mantra, invocation, conjuration, exorcism)
  2. колдовство (witchcraft, sorcery, wizardry, incantation, enchantment, witchery)
  3. магическая формула (incantation, paternoster)
  4. чары (spell, charms, charm, glamor, sorcery, incantation)


 "Double, double toil and trouble / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."
 These lines, cackled by the Weird Sisters in Shakespeare's "Macbeth,"
 are part of the most famous incantation –- or magic spell made of
 words -– in English literature.

 Incantation shares a Latin source with enchant, both of which are
 related to chant. An incantation, then, summons a thing or action into
 being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before it
 became the catchword of stage magicians, abracadabra was regarded as a
 powerful incantation capable of warding off serious disease. The
 phrase hocus pocus may be a corruption of a seventeenth-century
 incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist,
 "hoc est corpus."

 A typical incantation to install a source package looks something like
 this.

 The magician said an incantation and then pulled a rabbit from an empty hat.

  6. несвойственный (alien, unladylike, extrinsic, extrinsical)
  7. чужестранный (outlandish, alien)

 verb
  1. отчуждать (alienate, estrange, expropriate, alien)

 Something that's alien is different or foreign. In science fiction,
 space aliens come from other planets. In reality, illegal aliens come
 from other countries.

 When we talk about aliens, or things that are alien, we're talking
 about things and people that are different and strange to us. Like an
 alien from outer space. Some people are afraid of illegal aliens from
 other countries. Besides people, experiences can be alien. If you've
 never owned a cat, then having a cat is alien to you. You can also
 alienate people by making them feel weird, disconnected, and alone:
 like an alien.

  4. художественная литература (fiction, imaginative literature, belles-lettres)
  5. выдумка (artifice, invention, fiction, fabrication, story, fib)

 A fiction is a deliberately fabricated account of something. It can
 also be a literary work based on imagination rather than on fact, like
 a novel or short story.

 The Latin word fictus means “to form,” which seems like a good source
 for the English word fiction, since fiction is formed in the
 imagination. Like its literary cousins fable, legend, and myth,
 however, fiction has a slightly darker additional meaning: a
 deliberate lie or untruth. When we talk about "the line between fact
 and fiction," we're talking about the difference between truth and
 lies.

 Fiction books are easy, they use a simple type of file system
 commonly known as alphabetical by author.

 Something affirmative expresses agreement or approval, like the
 affirmative nod your mother gives you when you ask to be excused from
 the dinner table. A formal way of saying "Yes" is "Affirmative!"

 Anything affirmative is approving of something: affirmative words
 support someone or something. Being affirmative is the opposite of
 being negative or contradicting. A pat on the back is affirmative so
 is a signature you need to complete a form. Also, you can use
 affirmative as a formal way of saying yes to something. This is common
 in the military. It might sound a little odd, but if your teacher

   If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if
   you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.

   Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean "dark, dim,"
   "unclear, hard to understand," or "insignificant, humble." We tend to
   use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear,
   an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure
   poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be
   used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a

   Myriad is one of those words rarely used in speech but only in written

   amplified

   усиливается

   adjective
    1. расширенный (expanded, enlarged, widened, broadened, amplified, exaggerated)
    2. увеличенный (increased, enlarged, aggrandized, amplified, megascopic)

   The verb amplify means to crank up the volume. Speakers amplify, or
   raise, the volume of the noise coming through a microphone so that
   everyone at the rock show can hear.

   Amplify comes from the Old French word amplifier meaning "to enlarge
   or expand." It refers to making a sound “expand,” but it can also
   crank up something like a disagreement — if you spread rumors, you
   might amplify an argument. It can “enlarge” an idea — if you don't
   realize how bad your health is, your doctor might amplify your test
   results by explaining them to you in simple, and possibly frightening
   terms.

    2. сухость (dryness, aridity, drought, aridness)
    3. жажда (thirst, hunger, itch, want, drought)
    4. сухость воздуха (drought)

   When there is a drought somewhere, there's not enough rainfall. In
   certain areas, a drought can last for weeks, months, sometimes even
   years! Forget about running your lawn sprinkler during a drought; the
   water is needed for drinking, bathing, and toilet flushing.

   Another way drought can be used is to refer to a shortage of something
   (other than rainfall) that lasts for a long period of time, like a
   drought in job growth during a recession. Typically a drought is not a
   good thing and something you hope to avoid. For example, if your
   friend Kenny hasn't gone on a date in five years, it's safe to say
   that he is having a romantic drought.

    8. проворный (prompt, agile, nimble, quick, alert, rash)

   A rash is something that spreads like wild fire — red itchy skin or a
   series of unfortunate events. It can also describe an impulsive, wild
   decision.

   As an adjective, rash has meant "quick, vigorous" since the 1300s by
   way of Scotland. The meaning shifted to "reckless" a few hundred years
   later, and can still be used that way — a "rash decision" is a sudden,
   not well thought out one. Rash, the noun that no one wants on their
   skin, came a few hundred years after that, but from the French word
   rache which at some point meant "ringworm." Ringworm still gives us a
   red, itchy rash. Fun! Rash can also mean a lot of unpleasant things
   happening in a short amount of time, like robberies or earthquakes.

   Don't make rash decisions.

   A dodgy situation is risky and suspicious. A dodgy person is skilled

   When a person or situation is called dodgy, it's a clue that they
   should be dodged if at all possible. A job might be dodgy because it's
   illegal or dangerous. A shortcut might be dodgy if it could damage
   your car. Running a marathon without preparation is very dodgy.
   Similarly, a dodgy person is untrustworthy because they’re evasive,

   Sake means the purpose for doing something. You might run a

   Sake comes from the old English term for "affair," or "cause of
   guilt." We usually use sake to talk about the motivating cause of
   something we do. You might study hard for the sake of your grades. But
   then again, you might blow off your studies for the sake of having

    1. приличный (decent, respectable, seemly, proper, decorous, comfortable)
    2. порядочный (decent, respectable, fair, sportsmanlike, clean-living)
    3. пристойный (decent, proper, decorous)

    8. подходящий (suitable, appropriate, right, suited, fitting, decent)
    9. сдержанный (restrained, discreet, reserved, restrain, moderate, decent)
   10. нестрогий (decent)

   The adjective decent means sufficient or acceptable. The local diner
   you like to frequent may not serve a four-star breakfast, but it
   probably has decent food.

   Though the concept is a little dated, people of "decent society" are
   socially correct. They don't break the law, behave rudely, use
   impolite language, or wear inappropriate clothing. Decent can also
   mean "nice": Holding the door for a woman with a stroller is the
   decent thing to do. Lastly, decent can also mean "appropriately
   clothed" (or just "not naked"). If a stranger is knocking on your
   door, you're probably not going to answer it until you're decent.

   Re career at Google, I wouldn't worry about that too much - they certainly
   seem like a decent company, but there's plenty more great tech companies out
   there, and if you were good enough to get into Google, you should be well
   set for them too.

   noun
    1. измерение (measurement, measuring, dimension, metering, mensuration, meterage)
    2. обмер (measurement, measuring, scaling)
    3. система мер (measurement)

   Taking a measurement involves figuring out how long something is or
   what it weighs or how fast it is. Measurements usually require
   something like a ruler or a stop watch.

   When you step on the scale to check your weight, you're getting a
   measurement. When you pull out a ruler and measure a piece of paper,
   you're making a measurement. Astronomers make measurements of how far
   away other planets and stars are. In the Olympics, a timer does a
   measurement of who's fastest, to see who won a race. Anytime you're
   using a measuring device to come up with a number for something,
   you're taking a measurement.

   Precise measurements are required.

 When offered a choice between two things you don't like, you might
 choose neither. Whereas "either" means you would pick one, neither
 closes the door on both, saying you do "not" choose "either" one.

 The adjective neither comes directly from Middle English, evolving
 from the word nawther. Neither is versatile, and can be used as a
 pronoun, ("Neither of your ideas works"), or an adjective ("Neither
 plan can be used"). It can also be used as a conjunction, in which
 case it is usually paired with "nor" ("We can use neither your first
 suggestion nor your second one"). Sounds like you're having a tough
 day.

   16. необработанный (raw, rough, undressed, unmanufactured, crude, rude)
   17. невежественный (ignorant, unintelligent, untaught, rude, empty-headed)

   Rude describes a type of behavior that isn't appropriate and usually
   isn't very nice, either — like yelling "You stink!" at a children's
   talent show.

   Rude refers to bad behavior or just plain bad manners. For example,
   children are taught to say "please" and "thank you" or they are
   considered rude. A rude person needs a little work — rude also means
   crude or basic, like a rude cabin out in the woods that barely keeps
   the rain out. It can be a sudden realization, too. If you wake up and
   see your breath, it's a rude awakening that the heat's not working.

   If a characteristic or ability is already present in a person or

   ability to speak whereas animals do not.

   Innate can also be used figuratively for something that comes from the

   innate sense of style? Some kids seem to have an innate sense of
   fairness where others seem to be natural bullies. In some contexts,
   innate means inherent. There is an innate sadness in certain types of

   From the words warder, meaning “to protect”, and robe, meaning a
   “piece of clothing,” wardrobe originally meant an entire room where a
   person's clothing was stored. Nowadays, most people don’t have an
   entire room for their clothes, so the word wardrobe has downsized to
   just a large cabinet, or the clothing itself. A wardrobe can also be
   the costumes (or the costume department) of a theater company or

   deliberately sink something, as when you capsize your friend's remote
   controlled speedboat on purpose. When sink is a noun, it's the water
   basin in your kitchen or bathroom. The Old English root of both kinds
   of sink is sincan, "become submerged or go under," from a Germanic
   source.

   it's also a movement that has some meaning, intention, or emotion
   behind it.

   When you use gesture, you are entering into a whole history of human
   communication, because there is no language that exists entirely
   without gesture (a fun fact to bring up at parties). People can't
   communicate without gesture. It's so connected to intention that there
   is a phrase "empty gesture," used to mean an action or movement that
   is without genuine feeling.

    stress their points

   A snail is a small mollusk with a spiral-shaped shell. Snails are
   famous for moving very slowly, and for leaving a trail of slime behind
   them.

   If you see snails on a restaurant menu, they're more likely to be
   listed as escargot, or "edible snail" in French. There are three
   general categories of snails: land snails, sea snails, and freshwater
   snails. They all have shells that they can retreat within—without a
   shell, a similar animal is instead called a slug. Snail can be traced
   back to the diminutive form of the Old English snaca, "snake" or
   "creeping thing."

   Your appearance is how you look: your clothes, hair, facial
   expression, skin tone, and posture all factor into your overall
   appearance.

   Ever had to go somewhere you didn't want to go? If you stopped by just
   briefly, you made an appearance. But this word more often has to do
   with how things look. Your appearance is created by everything people
   can see, from your hair down to your shoes. Sometimes appearances can
   be deceiving: maybe you give an appearance of confidence, but you're

   A mug is an informal vessel for drinking coffee or tea, as opposed to
   a china tea cup or a demitasse espresso cup, for example. Informally,
   a mug is a face: that's why a mug shot of a prisoner is a picture of
   his face right after he has been arrested. When it's a verb, mug means
   "rob someone while threatening violence." This meaning came from an

   noun
    1. запоздалая мысль (afterthought)
    2. раздумье (meditation, reflection, afterthought, reflexion, recollection)
    3. запоздалое раздумье (afterthought)

   An afterthought is something you think of or add later. You might
   quickly wrap a gift and then stick a bow on it as an afterthought just
   before you hand it to the birthday boy.

   Sometimes calling something an afterthought is a bit of an insult — a
   movie reviewer might complain that female characters seem added on as
   afterthoughts, or a diner at a fancy restaurant could note that while
   the meat is well-cooked, the vegetables are nothing but an
   afterthought. This word has been used since the 1600s, a compound of
   after and thought.

   Windows has attempted to catch up in many ways, but they
   feel to me more like an afterthought.

    5. обвернуть (wrap up, envelop, bundle)
    6. быстро уйти (bundle, bundle away, bundle off, bundle out)

   A bundle is a package of things wrapped together. To wrap things
   together in a compact way is to bundle them. A baby wrapped up in a
   blanket is a bundle of joy, and if it’s cold outside, bundle up!

   Bundle comes from the Middle Dutch word for bind, which is what you do
   when you bundle stuff — you bind it together. It also means to wrap in
   warm clothes. This is a word for things that are tightly packed
   together. If you get a package in the mail, it's a bundle. If you have
   knickknacks all over the place, you'll need to bundle them when you
   move by putting them in a box.

   Immensely is an adverb that means vastly, or very, or hugely. An

   If you know that immense means huge, then you probably already have a
   sense of what immensely means. It's a word for describing the enormous
   degree of something. A New York Times bestseller is an immensely
   popular book. Any offensive lineman is an immensely large human being.
   The earth is immensely old. A mouse can't be described as doing
   anything immensely, but an elephant does things immensely all the

   Arise is a verb that means to get up, maybe to stand or get out of
   bed, like when you arise in the morning to get ready for the day.

   The verb arise can apply to people when they get up but it can also
   apply to issues or situations that come up, like problems that arise
   when a leader takes away people's rights. What happens next? People
   might arise, meaning they rebel, protesting the leader's actions,
   maybe even declaring that they are no longer under his or her rule. If
   this happens, a new political party will likely arise, meaning "come
   into existence."

   Charge can mean electricity received, as in the shock you’d feel if

   Charge has many meanings. Charge is what a cavalry does when it rushes
   towards enemy lines. A charge is also the cost of something. When you
   are “in charge,” it means that you are in command of everything. And
   when you are “in charge of,” it means that you have a specific
   responsibility. And when you are excited about something, you “get a
   charge out of it.” If you like power, you might get a charge out of
   being in charge.

   DEFINITION

   adjective
    1. having great influence on someone or something.
       "her work is influential in feminist psychology"

   If your grandfather worked his whole life in a circus and inspired you
   to wear clown shoes, you could describe your grandfather as very
   influential in your life. Something that exerts influence or power can
   be called influential.

   You could read a deeply meaningful book that becomes influential to
   you, or there might be an important person in your life who is
   strongly influential over various decisions you make. The Latin word
   influentem, "flowing in," is the root of the Old French influence,
   which described the power was believed to flow from the stars.

   Over time, the leading
   developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of

   the "Unix philosophy."

    2. причудливый (bizarre, quaint, fancy, whimsical, fanciful, freakish)
    3. эксцентричный (eccentric, bizarre, whimsical, queer, erratic, kinky)

   Someone or something bizarre is odd or unusual in appearance, style,
   or character. If your teacher walks into class wearing a purple boa,
   lime-green cowboy boots, and a scuba mask, you might comment, "How
   bizarre!"

   Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected
   elements. Bizarre was borrowed from French, from bizarro "angry,
   fierce, strange," from Spanish, "bold, like a knight." The Spanish
   word was probably influenced by Basque bizar "a beard," since beards
   were taken as signs of energy and spirit. Nowadays it takes more than
   a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is often
   called bizarre — like when your little brother decides that he will
   communicate only in Pig Latin.

   Microsoft Windows has many
   bizarre and oddly placed features making it hard to secure and operate

   ленивый

   adjective
    1. ленивый (lazy, indolent, slothful, idle, sluggish, shiftless)

   While lazy actually means being averse to work or avoiding it, it can
   also be used to describe something slow-moving or unenergetic, like
   when you stroll down the garden path with a lazy gait, not in a hurry
   to get anywhere.

   The adjective lazy is thought to come from the Low German lasich,
   meaning "idle or languid." You were offended at being called lazy, but
   you just didn't have the energy to defend yourself. After all, who
   doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday afternoon? Former President of Poland Lech
   Walesa once considered the benefits of being lazy when he said, “It's

   The adjective worst describes the thing that is the least good, like
   this awful pizza, the worst we've ever had in our lives.

   Worst means "the least favorable outcome." You may have heard the

   The adjective tough is good for describing hard times. If you just got
   mugged, lost your job, got the flu, and broke your toe, you're having
   a really tough week.

   Tough means "strong, hard, unbending," and you can use it to describe
   many different things, like a tough exam, or a tough piece of beef
   jerky, or a tough day that you just want to be over. If a judge
   punishes criminals harshly to set examples, she's "tough on crime." We
   call people toughs if they seem likely to beat you up. Tough things
   are made to withstand a beating, like the tires on your mountain bike.

   порыв

   noun
    1. порыв (impulse, gust, fit, burst, puff, elan)
    2. порыв ветра (gust, flatus, blow, flaw, windflaw, scud)
    3. вкус (taste, flavor, liking, palate, style, gust)
    4. хлынувший дождь (gust)
    5. взрыв гнева (gust)
    6. понимание (understanding, insight, comprehension, conception, realization, gust)
    7. острый вкус (gust)
    8. приятный вкус (gust, relish)

   A gust is a strong, short burst of air. If you're walking around on a
   brisk, cold day, hold on to your papers tightly — a gust of wind could
   sweep in and send your notes flying into the air.

   You've probably seen the famous image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a
   sidewalk with her white dress blowing in the breeze from a subway
   grate — that might be the most famous gust of air in popular culture.
   Gust comes from the Old Norse word gustr, meaning "a cold blast of
   wind." Gust also can be used to describe other things that come on
   with a sudden burst, like a violent gust of rain or an unexpected gust
   of sadness.

   and that they weren't in pain and that it all happened so fast.

 эгоистичный

 adjective
  1. эгоистичный (selfish, egoistic, egoistical, hoggish, self-centred)
  2. эгоистический (egoistic, selfish, egoistical, self-loving)

 Someone who is selfish cares only about themselves and doesn't
 consider others. If a ship is sinking and you refuse to let anyone
 else into your 4-person lifeboat, you're extremely selfish.

 Selfish combines the pronoun self-, meaning to or for yourself, with
 the suffix-ish, for "having the character of." So if your actions are
 selfish, they all have to do with getting something for yourself, like
 attention, or candy, or power. Selfish is usually meant to be an
 insult; someone selfish goes beyond just taking care of themselves,
 and actively takes from others. The opposite of selfish is
 self-sacrificing, which means, "giving everything to others and
 sacrificing your own needs."

 I immediately WISHED I would've been with them, but
 then immediately felt selfish and therefore guilty.

 I joined them for selfish reasons.

   дыра, отверстие

   A hole isn't just a hollow space dug out of the ground or punched out
   of something. When you're talking casually with friends, you can also
   call a place that's small or dumpy a hole, like a rundown town or a
   really tiny apartment.

   The word hole comes from the Old English hol meaning "cave" which in
   prehistoric times wasn't just a dark space to hide, it was a home. The
   word hole is used in many contexts from a rabbit hole where rabbits
   live to "a hole in one" — the golf term. And, if you're feeling sick
   or depressed, you can hole up in your room — hiding away from the
   world, watching TV for hours.

   All the while, my
   heart felt like it was literally a black hole, sucking my sternum in with
   the most immense pressure.

    6. бескрайний (boundless, immense, horizonless)
    7. замечательный (remarkable, wonderful, great, admirable, marvelous, immense)

   Immense means very large in size, amount, or degree. You might
   describe the ocean as immense, or your homework load, or the slice of
   cake your brother took, leaving you a tiny sliver.

   This word has an immense number of near synonyms: huge, great,
   enormous, vast, gigantic, colossal, mammoth, copious, tremendous are a
   few of the more common ones. If you're having immense difficulty
   deciding which word to use, just plain "very big" might do.

   14. стискивание (pressure, clench)
   15. затруднительные обстоятельства (pressure)

   You feel pressure when something presses on you –- whether a physical
   force or a stressful situation. If you don't crack under the pressure
   of witnessing the accident, you will calmly apply pressure on the
   driver's wound until help arrives.

   The pressure of a looming deadline might cause you to finally get to
   work on an assignment. Pressure can also be a verb, like when your
   friend pressures you to go rock climbing despite your fear of heights.
   The rocks you would rather not climb were formed long ago by extreme
   heat and pressure. While climbing, your friend's blood pressure may
   rise right along with yours when she sees how clumsy you are.

   heart felt like it was literally a black hole, sucking my sternum in with

   I have low blood pressure.

   непобедимый

   adjective
    1. непобедимый (invincible, unbeatable, unconquerable)

   Something invincible is victorious over everything. Disease, death,
   destruction? No match for something truly invincible. Mere humans who
   imagine they're invincible, however, will inevitably prove that
   they're not.

   Invincible comes ultimately from the Latin verb vincere, "to conquer."
   Many of the uses for invincible are for describing someone or
   something victorious or unbeatable at what they do. A company can be
   invincible when it outsells similar businesses for years, a tennis
   player is invincible after winning all of the majors in a year or a
   career, and Superman and the Indomitable Snowman are invincible as
   long as they stay away from kryptonite and the warm sun.

   For
   those of you reading, you need to know that you are not invincible to things
   like this happening.

   Tom thinks he's invincible.

    1. заслуживать (deserve, earn, be worth)
    2. быть достойным (merit, deserve, live up to)
    3. стоить (cost, be worth, be, lose, count for, deserve)

   We deserve things based on our actions. For example, many people
   believe murderers deserve the death penalty.

   Deserve is used in many ways, but it always carries a sense of balance
   or justice. If someone receives an award for their work, it means they
   deserve praise and attention. If you deserve a day off, it means
   you've been working hard and have earned a vacation. If you threw a
   book during class, you deserve a punishment of some kind. Many laws —
   and lots of arguments — are about deciding what different people
   deserve. It's often hard to tell.

   There was nothing they did to deserve this.

   You deserve the prize.

    1. выигрывать случайно (fluke)
    2. терпеть неудачу (fail, miscarry, break down, burst up, suffer a setback, fluke)
    3. обмишулиться (fluke)

   A fluke is an unexpected stroke of good luck. It was a fluke to find
   that fifty dollar bill on the ground, and it made you smile for the
   rest of the day.

   The word fluke was first used in 1857 in reference to a lucky shot at
   billiards. If something good happens to you by chance when you're not
   expecting it, that's a fluke. The word fluke can also be used in a
   negative or insulting way. For example, if your favorite sports team
   loses an important game, you could complain that it was just a fluke
   that the other team won — meaning they didn't deserve to win and
   somehow got lucky.

   This is
   happenstance, this is a fluke/bad luck/coincidence or whatever you want to
   call it.

   Their triumph was no fluke.

   совпадение

   noun
    1. совпадение (coincidence, overlap, concurrence, alignment, congruence, conjunction)
    2. случайное стечение обстоятельств (coincidence)

   People love to talk about strange coincidences––like you and your
   mother having the same birthday, or two unrelated families named "The
   Martins" living next door to each other. A coincidence is something
   that's not planned or arranged but seems like it is.

   Technically, a coincidence is an occurrence of events that happen at
   the same time by total accident––like you and a kid from your class at
   school both visit the Grand Canyon on the same day. Weird. If some guy
   is stalking you, always running into you wherever you go, this is not
   a coincidence. That guy has memorized your schedule.

   This is

   verb
    1. сажать в тюрьму (imprison, jail, lock up, put to prison, gaol, dungeon)
    2. заключать в тюрьму (imprison, jail, incarcerate, prison, cage, confine)

   A jail is a place where people are confined while they're being
   punished for a crime. If you end up getting a mug shot and put behind
   bars, chances are you are In jail.

   To arrest someone and put them in a jail cell is to jail them. Jail
   prisoners are often simply waiting for their trials — they've been
   charged with a crime, but they haven't yet been found to be guilty (or
   innocent). Jail was originally spelled gayhol, and in Britain it's
   also spelled gaol. This can be traced back to the Medieval Latin
   gabiola, from Late Latin caveola and the Latin cavea, "cage or
   enclosure."

   After court I was whisked away to the county jail, and few days later to a
   prison reception center.

   The driver was jailed for two years

   noun

   To elect is to choose. A group of citizens may elect the next
   president, or you may just elect to stay home during the blizzard.

   Most famously, in the political sense, elect means to choose a person
   for public office, usually via an election. It also means to choose a
   particular course in life of major consequence. You probably don't
   elect to drink Pepsi over Coke, but you do elect to study a particular
   major at college, or sign up for military service.

   For example, a batch

   verb
    1. группировать программы (batch)
    2. пакетировать (batch)

   A batch is a completed group, collection, or quantity of something,
   especially something that's just been made. You might, for example,
   bake a batch of cookies to take to your new neighbor.

   A company that makes soap might deliver a batch, loaded on a truck, to
   a new store in Vermont, and if you manage a bakery you might declare,
   "That's it! This is our last batch of gingerbread until next year!" In
   computer lingo, a batch is, similarly, a group or collection of
   records. The Old English root, bæcce, means "something baked," from
   bacan, "bake."

   For example, a batch
   renaming utility for a photo browser may elect to use percent signs for
   placeholders such as the current date, image sequence number, or file
   format:

   A batch of cakes was made yesterday.

    2. случайный (random, casual, accidental, chance, occasional, arbitrary)
    3. своевольный (willful, headstrong, high-handed, opinionated, arbitrary, contrary)
    4. деспотический (despotic, oppressive, autocratic, arbitrary, domineering, autocratical)
    5. капризный (capricious, whimsical, cranky, naughty, fractious, arbitrary)

   Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of
   following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach
   using a totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.

   Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning "judge" (arbiter),
   that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker
   arbitrary is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making
   rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting
   players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be
   picking names out of a hat.

   There is also a mechanism for an arbitrary number of keyword parameters.

   A simpleton is an idiot — a person without much common sense or

   This is one of many words — such as moron, dummy, and dimwit — that
   insult a person's intelligence. A simpleton is the opposite of a

   could be considered a hillbilly or yokel as well as a dullard or
   dunce.

   We often use tremendous if something is super wonderful. If someone

   are getting a huge bonus, you might exclaim, “Tremendous!” Tremendous
   comes from the Latin for "trembling," and is connected with fear.

    7. повышение в цене (boost)
    8. добавочное напряжение (boost)
    9. давление нагнетателя (boost)

   Think of the word boost as meaning "help up." Maybe you need a boost
   getting over a fence (hmm — are you sneaking in or sneaking out?), or
   maybe you are feeling low and need to boost your spirits — chocolate,
   anyone?

   Sometimes words appear that really don't have any clear origins. Boost
   is one of those words, but it's a fun word, and it's thought that
   maybe it has some connection to boose, a Scots dialect word that
   carries the idea of a push. A slang meaning of the word is to sneakily

    1. неизбежно (inevitably, necessarily, fatally, by the nature of the case, by the nature of things, from the nature of the case)
    2. неминуемо (inevitably)

   If something is totally unavoidable, it is inevitably going to happen.
   Inevitably, the sun will come up tomorrow.

   The adverb inevitably comes from the negative of the French word for
   "avoid" or "shun." There are things you can put off for a while, but
   inevitably you're going to have to deal with them at some point, like
   telling your family that you crashed the car. No matter how
   free-spirited you imagine yourself, unless you are independently
   wealthy, you will inevitably have to settle down and get some sort of
   job, like writing and editing word definitions.


   Its a question one inevitably asks himself at one point in his life.

   from it all. A spot under a shady tree might be your favorite retreat
   from the sun, or your bedroom in the basement may serve as a retreat
   from your siblings.

   In the military sense, the noun retreat means the withdrawal of
   troops. The British retreat after the Battles of Lexington and Concord
   gave the American colonists an early taste of victory during the
   American Revolution. As a verb, retreat means to back out of something
   — like a lawyer who is forced to retreat from his argument when the
   opposing evidence is too convincing.

   I was using this time as a retreat more than anything.

   If something is sour, it has a tangy or sharp flavor, like a lemon.
   Your brother may love the taste of limes, while they're way too sour
   for you.

   Sometimes this adjective is used to describe a fermented odor (the way
   milk smells when it goes bad), or a wrong note in music, or even a
   terrible mood: "Mom was acting so sour that I didn't even ask her if
   we could have pizza for dinner." Sour comes from the Old English sur,
   "sour, tart, or fermented."

   some sour luck in two prospective relationships with women I thought at the
   time were promising.

   She sampled the wine and found it was sour

    7. успех (success, luck, hit, achievement, advance, prosperity)
    8. удачливость (luck, luckiness)

   Luck is chance or happenstance. If something happens from pure good
   luck, it seemingly came out of nowhere, based only on fate and not on
   anything you did to make it happen.

   If you find a fifty dollar bill on the sidewalk, you might exclaim,
   "What luck!" Alternately, if you lose all night at the poker table,
   you'll probably blame it on bad luck. In both examples, you're
   referring to a mysterious, unpredictable circumstance that affects
   your life by chance. Luck has a Middle Dutch root, luc, which is a
   shortened form of gheluc, "happiness or good fortune."

    3. украшать колоннами (pillar)

   If someone describes you as a pillar of strength, he's saying you're
   reliable and supportive, much like a pillar or column of a building
   that helps hold the structure up.

   The spelling of the word pillar looks like it has two pillars right at
   its center, holding the word up. Pillar is interchangeable with the
   word column, though you can't always use them in the same contexts.
   While a column and a pillar are both physical cylindrical structures,
   a column can also be the row running up and down on a chart, while a
   pillar is often someone or thing that is considered a foundation or
   support. Someone indispensable to your company might be considered a
   pillar to the organization.

    7. удаление из полости (aspiration)

   If your aspiration, or ambition, is to climb Mt. Everest someday, you
   better start training, because it’s a long, hard climb that requires a
   lot of preparation.

   Aspiration means "inhalation" or "breathing." So how did it come to
   mean "ambition" or "the will to succeed"? The Latin gives us a clue:
   spirare ("to breathe") and spiritus ("spirit"). It was once believed
   that our breath was our soul or spirit, which might explain why we
   talk about "breathing life into" something, or coming up with energy
   and ideas to invigorate it. How else to breathe life into something
   than with ambition and drive, in other words, "spirit"?

   We can communicate honestly our concerns,
   aspirations and ideas all the way down to the knitty gritty.

   A "cumber" is something that slows you down, and though the words

   DEFINITION

   adjective
    1. (of goods, especially clothing) made to order.
       "a bespoke suit"


   The man in the bespoke suit is likely to be either the best-dressed or
   the most overdressed person at your backyard barbecue, depending on
   how you look at it. Bespoke means custom-made.

   Clothing that's made to order, tailored especially for you, is called
   bespoke. It's an adjective that is more common in Britain than in the
   United States. Bespoke can also describe non-clothing items that are
   made-to-order, as well as the person who makes such things: a bespoke
   jeweler. The term was originally bespoken, meaning "spoken of or
   arranged beforehand." Obviously, if you wanted a custom-made suit, you
   had to make arrangements before buying it.

   We have our own bespoke system which is
   based on Scrapy, but full training will be provided in how to use it.

   He was well dressed in the finest bespoke clothing.
   James and Amy focused their business on the development of complex

   information are often mistaken for geniuses, but really they just have
   very good memories.

   To retain is to keep or maintain, whether in mind, possession or a
   certain condition. If you have a great personal assistant, you'll
   probably want to retain him for as long as you can. If your body is

   3. мольба (pleading, plea, supplication, prayer, entreaty, cry)
   4. обращение к музе (invocation)

  An invocation is an appeal to a higher power for help, such as a
  prayer for serenity or a plea to the rain gods during a drought.

  An invocation often refers to an appeal to something not of this
  world, such as a god or a spirit, but it can involve an appeal to any
  higher power, even one that is flesh and blood. During a close
  basketball game, for example, you may mutter an invocation to the
  former NBA star Michael Jordan asking that your team’s star player
  somehow gain the power to hit his jump shots. The word invocation can
  also be used in the sense of invoking a notable authority to support a
  position. If you say, “But my mom said I should never wear cheap
  clothing,” for example, that is an invocation of your mom in support
  of your desire to buy designer jeans.

   Concern is both a noun and a verb. As a noun it's something that you
   find particularly important. If you love pizza, getting the crust just
   so is a major concern during your pizza party.

   Concern can also be something or someone that makes you upset or
   anxious, like your concern over the quality of the pizza crust. It can
   be a feeling of sympathy, like when your mom expresses concern over
   your obsession with pizza crust. As a verb, concern means to be
   relevant to something. Your main goal today may concern studying for
   your math test. Concern can also describe worry. When you stay out

    6. способ для достижения цели (leverage)


   If you have leverage, you hold the advantage in a situation or the
   stronger position in a contest, physical or otherwise.

   The lever is a tool for getting more work done with less physical
   force. With the right leverage, you might be able to lift a heavy box.
   This refers to non-physical situations too: the power to move or
   influence others is also leverage. Since your boss has the power to
   fire you, that's a lot of leverage to get you to do what he wants. If
   your friend owes you a favor, you have leverage to get a favor of your
   own.

   The word entity originally meant "being, existence," and was borrowed
   from Medieval Latin entitas, from Latin ens, irregular form of esse
   "to be, exist." The suffix –ity means "quality or state." Medieval
   Christian philosophers, influenced by the Church Fathers and
   Aristotle, discussed the concept of ens "abstract being" versus esse
   "actual being."

   The adjective foreign is based on the Latin word foris, meaning
   “outside.” A foreign exchange student goes outside of his or her
   country to study. When you learn a foreign language, it is outside of
   the one you first learned. If you sleep late on the weekends, someone

   заинтересованные стороны

   A stakeholder is a person interested in a company. If you become CEO
   of a big company, you'll have to keep the interests of every
   stakeholder in mind, from the employees to the customers to the
   investors, whenever you make decisions.

   Supposedly people used to gamble by putting their money on a wooden
   stake, and a person called a stakeholder who wasn't involved in the
   betting would supervise to make sure everything was fair. No one uses
   wooden stakes anymore, but we still call the person who holds the
   money and monitors the betting the stakeholder, and people often use
   stake to mean "risk," or "investment." That's why someone who is
   invested in a business is also called a stakeholder.

   Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with
   information about the quality of the product or service under test.[1]
   Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the

   намерение

   noun
    1. намерение (intention, intent, plan, aim, purpose, mind)
    2. цель (goal, purpose, objective, aim, target, intent)

   adjective
    1. пристальный (close, staring, intent, fixed, undivided, undiverted)
    2. полный решимости (determined, intent, dead, dead-set)
    3. внимательный (attentive, careful, thoughtful, mindful, watchful, intent)
    4. занятый (busy, occupied, engaged, concerned, intent, deep)
    5. намеревающийся (intending, intent, going to)
    6. склонный (prone, inclined, apt, addicted, given, intent)
    7. настойчиво стремящийся (intent)
    8. погруженный (immersed, submerged, sunk, deep, buried, intent)

   If you are intent on doing something, you are determined to get it
   done. If you have an intent, you have a motive or purpose.

   Intention and intent are synonyms, but with a subtle difference.
   Intention implies a general desire or plan to accomplish something,
   while intent is a little stronger, indicating a firm resolve to get it
   done. Intent can be used as a noun or adjective. So you may be intent
   on finishing your homework, but the amount of it has you convinced of
   your teacher's ill intent.

   Test techniques include the process of executing a
   program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or
   other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for
   use.

   If you have an intent, you have a motive or purpose.

   adjective
    1. осуществимый (feasible, workable, enforceable, realizable, practicable, implementable)
    2. возможный (possible, feasible, eventual, potential, probable, likely)
    3. выполнимый (executable, feasible, doable, workable, implementable, manageable)
    4. вероятный (likely, probable, possible, credible, plausible, feasible)
    5. исполнимый (executable, feasible)
    6. правдоподобный (plausible, probable, colorable, specious, verisimilar, feasible)

   If something is feasible, then you can do it without too much
   difficulty. When someone asks "Is it feasible?" the person is asking
   if you'll be able to get something done.

   Feasible things are possible. If you have enough time, money, or
   energy to do something, it's feasible. Something might be feasible at
   one time and then not feasible at another time. Because of
   technological advances and competition with the Russians, going to the
   moon was feasible for the United States in the sixties. Often, people
   disagree about what's feasible, especially in politics, where how
   feasible a project is counts for a lot.

   As the number of possible tests for even simple software components is
   practically infinite, all software testing uses some strategy to select
   tests that are feasible for the available time and resources.

   [ˈfərniSH]

   If you provide something needed, you furnish it. You can furnish an
   answer to a question in an interview, furnish the snacks at a party,
   or furnish a room by filling it with couches and chairs.

   Just as furniture fills a room or a building, to furnish is to fill a
   need. Another word for furnish is "provide." A furnace furnishes heat
   (try saying that ten times fast). A job furnishes you with an income.
   Your parents furnish you with a place to live, furniture included.

   Although testing can determine the correctness of software under the
   assumption of some specific hypotheses (see hierarchy of testing difficulty
   below), testing cannot identify all the defects within software.[2] Instead,
   it furnishes a criticism or comparison that compares the state and behavior
   of the product against oracles—principles or mechanisms by which someone
   might recognize a problem.

   A gap is the space between two things. It can be physical (like "the
   gap between your two front teeth") or philosophical (like "the
   generation gap" between you and your parents).

   Gap is a small word that packs a lot; it can be used in a
   straightforward manner: in England, the signs in the subway station
   say, "Mind the gap" — in hopes that passengers will not wander into
   the space between the train and the platform. The American retailer,
   "The Gap," is said to have taken its name from the generation gap. The
   clothes were designed for teenagers and young adults, and therefore
   nothing your middle-aged parents would be caught dead in. Times
   change.

   One common source of
   expensive defects is requirement gaps, e.g., unrecognized requirements which
   result in errors of omission by the program designer.[6] Requirement gaps
   can often be non-functional requirements such as testability, scalability,
   maintainability, usability, performance, and security.

    1. упущение (omission, lapse, flaw, overlook, dereliction, default)
    2. пропуск (pass, skip, omission, permit, gap, out)
    3. опущение (omission, prolapse, lowering, prolapsus)
    4. пробел (space, gap, blank, void, lacuna, omission)
    5. оплошность (oversight, gaffe, misstep, lapse, omission, inadvertence)
    6. недомолвка (omission, reserve)

   If you make an omission, you leave something out. If you are a
   restaurant reviewer and you give a glowing review to a new restaurant
   but fail to mention that you own half of it, that's a significant
   omission.

   The noun omission comes from the verb, omit, which means to leave out.
   Omissions can be purposeful or a result of neglect. Was the omission
   of Aunt Suzy from your wedding invitation something you meant to do,
   or an accident? If you're cleaning the house but don't take out the
   garbage, you'll regret your omission when the garbage is stinking up
   the kitchen.

   Call something weird when it’s strange, bizarre, or strikes you as

   conceptual performance art.

   Our definition of weird is rooted in Germanic mythology, where the
   “weird sisters” were three funky-looking goddesses that controlled
   fate and destiny: We dropped the idea of destiny and clung to how
   weird the weird sisters looked. In today’s slang we even use weird as
   a verb, as in “to weird someone out” or make them feel uneasy.

   Very strange and unusual, unexpected, or not natural.

   A janitor is someone whose job is cleaning and maintaining a building.
   If your school always looks clean and orderly, be sure to thank the

   Another name for a janitor is a custodian, or in Britain, a caretaker.
   This job involves cleaning and caring for a school, hospital,
   apartment building, or workplace. Janitors may be responsible for
   cleaning bathrooms, hallways, and other common areas. Sometimes
   janitors will also sweep sidewalks, shovel snow, or do other outdoor
   maintenance. In the 16th century, a janitor was a "doorkeeper," from
   the Latin ianitor, "doorkeeper or porter," and the root ianua, "door."

    2. возражать (mind, object, object to, protest, contradict, retort)
    3. опровергать (refute, disprove, contradict, belie, rebut, confute)
    4. отрицать (deny, negate, disavow, gainsay, disown, contradict)

   "Contra-" usually means "against," and to contradict is to go against
   or say the opposite of what someone else is doing or saying. Sometimes
   to contradict is to frustrate with words, like when one person says
   "The sky is blue" and another says "No, it's azure."

   Denying or distorting the truth is a big part of trying to contradict.
   It can be harmless verbal back-and-forth, like when a husband and wife
   disagree just to disagree, or contradict each other to make a humorous
   point, but at other times people contradict something to make another
   person look like a liar. Often, a person who has lied will later
   contradict himself by saying something different from what he said
   earlier — and sometimes the two sides contradict each other, and
   neither is actually right.


   To say the opposite of what someone else has said
   Do I contradict myself?
   Recent evidence has contradicted established theories on this subject.

   DEFINITION

   adjective
    1. of or concerning the use of judgment.
       "judgmental errors"

   Oddly enough, people with good judgment are not usually considered
   judgmental. Judgmental is a negative word to describe someone who
   often rushes to judgment without reason.

   The adjective judgmental describes someone who forms lots of opinions
   — usually harsh or critical ones — about lots of people. Judgmental
   types are not open-minded or easygoing. Judgmental has the word judge
   at its root, which itself is from the Latin word judicem, which also
   means "to judge." Judgemental (with an extra "e") is considered a
   legitimate variant spelling of judgmental.



   moralistic
   Too quick to criticize people
   You must try not to be so judgmental about people.
   Be curious, not judgmental.

   вот

   interjection
    1. Вот! (Behold!, Lo!)
    2. Смотри! (Look!, Vide!, Behold!, Lo!)

   To behold is to see. You could behold the changing sky as the sun
   sets. It’s old-fashioned and fancy, so magicians like to use it, as in
   “Behold! I shall pull a rabbit out of my hat!”

   Have you ever heard "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"? That can
   help you remember that to behold is to see something and to hold it in
   your attention. To behold is to look intensely — it’s much more than a
   glance. A good example of beholding is when you take the time to check
   out something special like that beautiful sunset, or a bunny hopping
   out of a hat and handing out candy.

   Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity, When I give I give
   myself.

   Oh, snap! When something snaps, it breaks or separates suddenly, often
   with a cracking sound. A snap can also be a fastener on clothes. And
   if you like a song, you can snap your fingers to the beat or snap a
   selfie of yourself dancing.

   The verb snap is useful for many things that make a similar sharp
   sound, like when you snap your lunchbox shut, snap your fingers, or
   snap a whip. An animal's quick, strong bite is also a snap. As a noun,
   it can mean "fastener" or "the sound of a snap." A snap judgment is a
   decision you make almost instantaneously, and a cold snap is a short
   period of bitter weather.


   To cause something that is thin to break suddenly and quickly with a
   cracking sound:
   To suddenly become unable to control a strong feeling, especially
   anger.

   Some vandal's snapped off my car aerial again.
   She snapped the carrot in two.
   But many people snap whenever poor people come and beg for money.

   Rude describes a type of behavior that isn't appropriate and usually

   talent show.

   Rude refers to bad behavior or just plain bad manners. For example,
   children are taught to say "please" and "thank you" or they are
   considered rude. A rude person needs a little work — rude also means
   crude or basic, like a rude cabin out in the woods that barely keeps
   the rain out. It can be a sudden realization, too. If you wake up and

    3. считать (think, consider, count, feel, find, esteem)
    4. давать оценку (estimate, rank, esteem)
    5. рассматривать (consider, view, regard, examine, review, esteem)

   noun
    1. уважение (respect, consideration, esteem, regard, honor, homage)
    2. почтение (reverence, respect, respects, honor, esteem, homage)
    3. оценка (assessment, evaluation, rating, estimate, estimation, esteem)

   Esteem is all about respect and admiration. If you have high
   self-esteem, it means you like yourself. When you say, "My esteemed
   colleagues," you are saying you have nothing but the highest respect
   for them.

   Esteem derives from the same Latin word that gives us estimate, and
   back in the day, esteem, like estimate meant "to assess, or judge the
   value of something." That sense lingers today. When you say you hold
   someone in high esteem, it means you give them a high value. Unless
   you're a politician, in which case, when you say, "I hold my opponent
   in high esteem," you are most likely to follow that statement with a
   big "But...."


   Respect for or a good opinion of someone.
   Her work is highly esteemed by all her colleagues.

   невнимательный

   adjective
    1. невнимательный (inattentive, careless, remiss, heedless, unobservant, unheeding)
    2. неучтивый (discourteous, impolite, disobliging, inattentive)

   Someone who's inattentive isn't paying enough attention. An
   inattentive lunch companion might spend the whole meal texting on his
   phone.

   Inattentive people are sometimes distracted, like an inattentive
   babysitter who loses track of the kids he's watching at the
   playground. You can also be inattentive simply through indifference or
   boredom — if you're inattentive at the opera, you're not paying
   attention to it because you're not interested in it. Inattentive tacks
   the "not" prefix in- onto attentive, from the Latin root attendere,
   "give heed to" or "stretch toward."

   Not giving attention to someone or something:
   He was wholly inattentive to the needs of his children

   movie theater, you head straight to the popcorn stand.

   The noun admission stems from the Latin word admissionem, meaning "a
   letting in." It often refers to a fee charged for entry, but it can
   also describe the process of being granted entry. The university's
   admission of the new student was welcome news — now he has access to
   the school's research facilities. An admission can also be a
   confession that something is true, such as your brother's surly
   admission that he was the one who popped your bike tire.

** Externalities						      :Quora:
 [2017-06-14 Wed 12:02]
   noun
    1. внешность (appearance, exterior, look, outside, externality, outward)

   An externality is an outside factor or condition that can affect
   something else. A snow storm for example, is an externality that can
   cause delays at the airport.

   Externality comes from the Latin root word externus meaning "outside"
   or "outward." An externality is something on the outside that affects
   other things. Often an externality is a behavior or result of behavior
   by one party that affects others who have no choice in its happening.
   For example, factory pollution is an externality that can affect
   people's health and well-being. It's outside of their control and yet
   it has an impact on their lives.

   2 Externalities

   century, meaning “conditions surrounding and accompanying an event.”
   The Dalai Lama advised that “In the present circumstances, no one can
   afford to assume that someone else will solve their problems. Every
   individual has a responsibility to help guide our global family in the
   right direction.” Wise and timeless words, no matter the present
   circumstances.

   written all over garbage cans. That's just the Brits' way of saying
   trash. The word litter comes from the Old French litiere meaning
   "bed." Animals like dogs or cats have their offspring all in one
   birth, or on the same bed, making what we call a litter, or group of
   babies.
